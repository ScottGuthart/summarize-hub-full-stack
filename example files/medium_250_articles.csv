Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!

We just wanted everyone to know how much we appreciate everyone and how thankful we are for all our readers and writers here. We wouldn’t be anywhere without you, so thank you all for bringing informative, vulnerable, and important pieces that destigmatize mental illness and mental health.

Without further ado, here are ten of our top stories from last week, all of which were curated:

“Just as the capacity to love and inspire is universal so is the capacity to hate and discourage. Irrespective of gender, race, age or religion none of us are exempt from aggressive proclivities. Those who are narcissistically disordered, and accordingly repress deep seated feelings of inferiority with inflated delusions of grandeur and superiority, are more prone to aggression and violence. They infiltrate our interactions in myriad environments from home, work, school and the cyber world. Hence, bullying does not happen in isolation. Although there is a ringleader she looks to her minions to either sanction her cruelty or look the other way.”

“Even though the circumstances that brought me here were sad and challenging, I’m grateful for how this program has changed my life for the better. I can’t help but imagine what life would be like if everyone learned to accept their powerlessness over other people, prioritize their serenity, and take life one step at a time. We’ll never know, but I’d bet the world would be much happier.”

“The prospect of spending a horrible Christmas, locked in on a psychiatric unit, was one of the low points of my life. For weeks, the day room was festooned with cheesy decorations and a sorry pink aluminum tree. All of our “activity” therapies revolved around the holidays. We baked and decorated cookies. We fashioned quick-drying clay into ornaments that turned out to be too heavy for the tree. Crappy Christmas carols were background torture. It was hard to get pissed off at the staff because they were making the best with what they had.”

“Although I hate to admit it, even if my ex had never betrayed me, I still wouldn’t have been happy. I had set him up for an impossible job — to define me and make me whole. If I cannot find peace and contentment within myself, how could anyone else do it for me?”

“On a personal note, significant feelings of loss and sadness can still flare up from time to time. That’s only natural; it’s no reason for self-critique. No matter how resilient we purport to be, we are all emotionally vulnerable human beings. Besides, we aren’t talking about some conceptual loss that we can just mechanically compartmentalize away — we are talking about the loss of our fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers.”

“The next six weeks will be hard as cases continue to explode and government leadership remains nonexistent. I can’t control any of this. The only thing I can do is take deep breaths, remain vigilant when it comes to limiting exposure to the virus, and let lots of stuff go. I may always be a hypochondriac, but now that I recognize the beast, I’m hopeful I’ll be able to tame it.”

“From anecdotal news reports and informal surveys, there is evidence that for some of us, this pandemic-imposed isolation is a boon rather than a trial. One study on mixed emotions showed that those with lower emotional stability (“moody” personalities) are actually better at responding to uncertainty.”

“Every day I wish in my heart and soul that I didn’t have ME/CFS. Unfortunately, I do. It’s a result of a virus I had; 10–12 percent of people who experience a serious infection go on to develop ME. I’ve visualized life without CFS for over a year now; I can smell life without it, I can taste it. It’s in the smell of the lavender fields that I can no longer run through. It’s in the taste of the meals from my favorite restaurant that I can no longer walk to. It’s on the tip of my tongue. It’s in the potentialities; all the things I could be doing, as a twenty-four year-old, that I can’t. I cannot cross the chasm between the potential and the reality. And that’s nothing to do with manifestation.”

“Whether it’s cabin fever, redundancy, loss, or general Covid anxieties, this year has caused us to be exposed to more uncertainty than ever. Uncertainty creates unease and feelings of stress. Some of us may have taken this year as one to motivate — plan dream trips, and prepare and be inspired for what the future could bring. For the rest, it has caused us to become irrational, emotional, and reserved.

“To be more self-compassionate is a task that can be tricky because we always want to push ourselves and do better. Without realising it, this can lead to us being self-critical which can have damaging consequences.

It’s important to notice these times when we are harsh because we can easily turn it into self-compassion, which is linked to a better quality of life.”

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!

A guide to the curious and troubling impact of the pandemic and isolation

The coronavirus pandemic frustrates and confounds epidemiologists and immunologists, even after months of study. It frustrates politicians and public health officials dealing with mask non-compliance. It frustrates everyone stuck at home, whether they lost their job or adapting to Zoom.

After exposure to the virus, it first enters the lungs, using host machinery to replicate. The virus itself is just a genetic sequence enclosed in a protein and lipid coat. It binds the ACE2 receptors on lung cells, with a spike protein located on its protein-lipid coat. This receptor, attached to the virus, trafficks into the lung cell. Here the virus hijacks the machinery of the cell to replicate, damaging lung tissue and spreading throughout the body.

The ACE2 receptor, expressed in many regions of the body, is vulnerable to further entry of these viral particles. The ACE2 receptor regulates blood pressure, nutrient absorption and inflammation. These pathways converge and mediate brain health and disease.

The novel coronavirus perplexed us for many different reasons. A large majority of people who get it don’t display any symptoms, while some display symptoms for many months and others require ventilators to breathe. It is unclear whether someone infected with coronavirus retains long-term immunity.

Also, troubling findings implicate this disease in the induction of stroke and the worsening of mental health. The realization that there are likely long-term complications of coronavirus infection is worrying, as millions of people may require expensive coverage for this new pre-existing condition.

Those of us lucky to avoid being infected become more socially isolated and lonely. Many studies report the worsening of mental health symptoms, especially in frontline workers, nurses and doctors. These professionals are more prone to burning out and require extra care.

COVID-19 and Stroke

The cells in the brain require a disproportionate amount of energy to function. When deprived of oxygen, even for minutes, the cells begin to die, leading to a variety of debilitating sensory, motor or language deficits depending. When there is blood loss to a specific region of the brain, cells cannot use oxygen to generate energy. If there is a clot in an artery, fresh oxygen cannot travel to any regions primarily supplied by that blood vessel. These events, classified as ischemic strokes, cause lifelong disability in some of those afflicted.

Early findings in patients found abnormal clotting in blood vessels. Vessels around the lungs or even arterial blood-flow to the brain is interrupted. Thus, individuals infected with coronavirus who suffered abnormal blood clotting as a result, were at higher risk of stroke.

In June of 2020, researchers published a report of neurological symptoms in the New England Journal of Medicine. While they did not report common symptoms of having a stroke, they showed other strange brain-related features. Of thirteen COVID-19 patients who underwent brain imaging, three of them showed signs of an ischemic stroke. A subset of eight of these patients showed other types of inflammation, while eleven presented with a lack of blood flow to the frontal areas of the brain.

Though a preliminary observational study, it suggested that the coronavirus impacted blood clotting and flow to the brain. Several studies since identified swathes of patients suffering from ischemic strokes or brain/vascular inflammation. Another study reviewed the current state of evidence, concluding that 41% of patients suffering from neurological symptoms after COVID-19 infection, suffered from strokes. Larger studies however, are needed to decipher how common this is among all those infected with the novel coronavirus.

Depending on which region of the brain loses oxygen, stroke may manifest as a broad range of symptoms. If cells die in an area of the brain responsible for motor movement, it later manifests in unilateral or bilateral difficulties with movement. Other common symptoms involve fatigue, challenges with balance or walking, partial paralysis, pain or inattention to one entire side of the body. It prevents individuals from doing the things they do in their daily lives, such as dress themselves or go to the bathroom independently.

COVID-19 and Psychiatric Disorders

Either through neuroimmune signalling or by directly entering the cells of the brain, COVID-19 also contributes to psychiatric symptoms and disorders. It is unclear what role it may play in their pathology, but it may worsen existing conditions or as a contributing factor in its development.

One study compared individuals afflicted with the novel coronavirus to those in quarantine or the general public, finding elevated rates of depression (29.2%) in those with COVID-19. Another small study reported increased post-traumatic stress symptoms in these patients.

Individuals already living with psychiatric disorders reported a worsening of symptoms in two different studies. Several other studies reported depressive and anxious symptoms worsened among essential workers.

Another study surveyed >2000 individuals in Denmark, finding a reduction in overall psychological well-being measures during the pandemics. This study also reported that women were more negatively affected than men.

Additionally, it recognized that many older adults living in adult-care communities during shelter-in-place orders experience loneliness and depression. A study of older adults in San Francisco found that they showed increased rates of loneliness and depression.

We must do our best to check-up on our friends and loved ones. We are all affected differently by the pandemic, so it is important to recognize that the rates of anxiety, depression and stress-related disorders may arise.

COVID-19 Long-Haulers

Thousands of individuals initially infected with COVID-19, the long-haulers, continue to suffer symptoms many months later. On average, these individuals are women around the age of 44 who are otherwise healthy. Their infections were classified as mild severity because they could recover at home.

Facing stigma and in need of a community, several groups sprouted up to support each other. Originally disbelieved, they rallied to raise awareness of their predicament within the medical establishment. It should no longer be sufficient to classify individuals infected with COVID-19, who don’t require a hospital stay, as mild.

A few different studies report that most individuals affected with COVID-19 suffer from symptoms months later (Italy, UK, Germany). Intriguingly, many long-haulers did not produce high-levels of coronavirus antibodies. Many individuals experience pain, fatigue and many other debilitating symptoms.

These symptoms are consistent with disturbances in the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for many automatic physiological functions like breathing or heart-rate but also influence fatigue. Preliminary physiotherapy involves reconditioning the nervous system of patients so that they may regain some of these functions.

Mind Your Nose,"Mind Your Nose

How smell training can change your brain in six weeks — and why it matters.

By Ann-Sophie Barwich

When it comes to training your brain, your sense of smell is possibly the last thing you’d think could strengthen your neural pathways. Learning a new language or reading more books (and fewer social media posts) — sure. But your nose?

That’s because the olfactory system is one of the most plastic systems in your brain. Neuroplasticity describes how the brain flexibly adapts to changes in the environment or when exposed to neural damage. Stimulating the brain strengthens existing neural structures and further adds fuel to the brain’s capacity to remain adaptive, thereby keeping it young. And your smell system is particularly adept at repair and renewal. (Olfactory cells have recently been used in human transplant therapy to treat spinal cord injury, for example.)

One reason for the olfactory system’s adaptive responsiveness is that it undergoes adult neurogenesis. Humans grow new olfactory neurons every three to four weeks throughout their entire life, not just during child development. (These sensory neurons sit in the mucous of your nose, where they pick up airborne chemicals and send activity signals straight to the core of the brain.) If it weren’t for this ongoing regeneration of sensory cells in your nose, we would stop detecting smells after our first few colds.

Neural plasticity weakens as we grow old — and so does our sense of smell. Olfactory performance decreases around the age of 70 as the regeneration of olfactory neurons slows down. Yet this process of regeneration never stops entirely. Training your nose helps slow down that decline and offers a great way to increase your brain’s plasticity. That said, increasing your sensitivity to odors in the environment does not always sound desirable. Smell usually comes with negative connotations: that whiff of urine in the metro, that overpowering literal skunk, or that trail of body odor from the person walking in front of you. But paying more attention to the smells around you also has benefits, and not just for a greater enjoyment of food aromas and neighbors’ gardens.

Recent studies show that olfactory abilities correspond with differences in cortical areas involved in smell processing in the brain. Johannes Frasnelli, an olfactory scientist at the University of Quebec in Trois-Rivières, explained: “We did some studies where we saw that there is a link between the structure of certain brain regions-like the thickness of the cortex and the thickness of the gray matter layer in certain brain olfactory processing regions-and the ability to perceive.” Frasnelli and his colleagues found that people with better perceptual capacities had a thicker cortex. When they looked at people who had lost their sense of smell, they also saw a reduction of cortical matter in areas involved in odor processing.

That raises the question: Could you change the structure of your brain simply by smelling things? In 2019, Frasnelli’s group discovered that undergoing as little as six weeks of intense olfactory training results in significant structural changes in some regions of the brain (namely, the right inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral fusiform gyrus, and the right entorhinal cortex).

Participants were given three tasks with a cognitive component.

The first task was a classification task. Participants had to organize two simple odor mixtures by ordering each from lowest to highest concentration. The second was an identification task. Participants were presented with a target odor blended with a citrus scent in a specific ratio (4%). Then they were given the same blend in different ratios and asked to order them according to quality (more citrusy or less?). Lastly, the detection task: Was the learned target odor present in a range of 14 samples of different odor mixtures or not?

This entire exercise was undertaken each day for 20 minutes during the six weeks. Responses were monitored and evaluated on speed and accuracy.

Such intense olfactory training led to a general improvement in olfactory performance. Plus, the increase of olfactory skill was not restricted to the training exercises but also transferred to other olfactory abilities-abilities that had not been tested as part of the training. These perceptual tests included: the detection threshold of an odor, accuracy in odor discrimination (same or different?), cued odor identification (which of these four descriptors is correct?), and even free odor identification (identifying an odor without cues!).

Increasing insight into what the nose knows, and how it communicates with the brain, has broader implications-even philosophical ones. Old (yet still prevalent) cookie-cutter views of the mind coax us to believe that our senses are passive-indifferently picking up signals in the world that are then processed by the brain. Perception, in such views, is a process separate from cognition. Highly plastic systems such as olfaction present us with a much more intriguing and interwoven picture of the mind: Training your nose’s performance (just like other cognitive capacities) fundamentally shapes what you perceive by rewiring the system.

Your senses are far from being impartial transmitters; what you are able to perceive in the world ultimately hinges on the depth of your cognitive engagement with it. In other words, your mind does not emerge apathetically as a product of some remarkable, intricate molecular twists performed by the brain. The mind is enhanced by what you can train your brain to do. Just like strength is a result of muscle training, cognitive training of the senses is the bodybuilding of the brain.",https://medium.com/neodotlife/mind-your-nose-f0b097d533bb,,2020-10-10 20:17:37.132000+00:00,"Biotechnology,Neuroscience,Brain,Wellness,Science"

Surviving a Rod Through the Head,"You’ve heard of him, haven’t you? Phineas Gage. The railroad worker who survived an explosion that involved an iron rod piercing through his left cheek and out of his brain and skull.

Yeah.

I know.

You’re probably wondering “yeah, alright sweet. What about him?” Well, let’s just say that he was a really popular patient for the field of neuroscience (Cherry, par. 1). And what I found the most interesting about this tragic event was the science of his behavior afterward.

For those of you who don’t know much about Phineas Gage, let me fill you in with the help of my research.

Phineas Gage, 25 years old, was a railroad worker in Vermont. One day, at work, he was using an iron rod to handle explosive gun powder. As he was using the iron rod to handle the gun powder, an explosion suddenly occurred. The iron rod then went through his left cheek and brain. Fortunately, he survived and was able to talk and walk after the accident (Cherry, par. 2–3).

Why did people say that Phineas Gage was a “different person” after his accident? It actually has to do with neuroscience.

The iron rod went through his brain, in particular, it went through the frontal lobe of his brain. Does this mean that the frontal lobe of your brain has to do with the kind of person you are? To answer this question, we have to understand what the frontal lobe in our brain is responsible for.

Our frontal lobes are responsible for many things. Some of them are higher-order thinking, personality, and decision making. This explains why people who knew Phineas Gage said that he was a totally different person after the accident. Since the iron rod went through his frontal lobe, it means that his personality and thinking, as a whole, completely changed, making him seem like he was a whole different person due to the way he started acting.

This accident and the treatment of Phineas Gage actually played a big role in the field of neurology. His case helped scientists better understand the role of the frontal cortex of the brain (Cherry, par. 16–17).

"Mentally, Young Adults Are Suffering Most From COVID","Mentally, Young Adults Are Suffering Most From COVID

“When it comes to having a painful feeling, the only way out is through.”

“Young individuals reported higher acute stress and depressive symptoms than older respondents, suggesting that despite being most deadly for older populations at the time of our data collection, the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have had widespread impacts across populations.” — Holman et al., Science Advances 2020

It’s no secret that COVID-19 and the pandemic have been detrimental to people’s mental health. However, the group that’s suffered the most from COVID-19 is young adults, who have had the biggest mental toll from COVID. Holman et al. found that 62.9 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds reported an anxiety or depressive disorder, and a quarter found they were using more than alcohol or drugs to cope with their pandemic stress. The researchers found that a quarter of the age group “seriously considered suicide” between mid-March to mid-April.

The conclusion from those findings is that young people are suffering most mentally from COVID. Unfortunately, I don’t find these findings that surprising. I know a lot of people struggle with COVID. I’m struggling with COVID, and I’m in that age range of 18- to 24-year-olds — and I experience that phenomenon as much as anyone in my age range.

But Claudia Wallis at Scientific American reports on more than just the mental health of youth mental health during COVID. A report from the CDC in August found that incidences of anxiety symptoms tripled and depression quadrupled in a representative sample. And the most affected are people who had pre-existing mental health issues, people of color, and low-income individuals, so the vulnerable individuals in society are more vulnerable during the pandemic.

Interestingly enough, Ettman et al. found that Asian individuals saw an almost fivefold increase in depression, and some psychiatrists who talked to Wallis attributed that to racism and slurs related to the Asian-Americans. As an Asian-American, the pandemic is forcing me to confront anti-Asian racism in a way I’ve never done so before. According to Holman et al., young people may have been more depressed because:

“[They] may have had more disruption in life events: graduations, weddings, the senior year of college and of high school. All those transitions were disrupted, as well as school and social connections, which we know are very important for young people.”

And the researchers also found that increased exposure to media coverage about the coronavirus led to more distress. Sensationalist reports lead to more anxiety and depression, and clearly the lack of social connection also disproportionately affects young people. Psychologist Logan Jones stresses that much of the reporting these days keeps people hooked on the news cycle, and keeps people addicted to the news. As such, Jones emphasizes the importance of keeping boundaries.

“Consuming too much of this kind of news, whether actively or passively, can be very toxic, and what you hear has an impact on your mood,” Jones says.

The CDC also states that the mental health of young adults has been impacted socially, emotionally, and mentally. They attribute these mental health concerns to the trauma faced at a developmental age, and all hands are on deck for parents, caregivers, and other adults to support children and young people. Part of that trauma is a result of changes in routines, employment, and educational challenges, a loss of security and safety, and missed significant life events.

As a teacher during COVID, almost all of my students say they want to return to the physical school building during COVID. They report being more lonely and isolated, and can’t wait to return to see their friends and teachers again. My school is emphasizing more relationship-building activities and prioritizing mental health during lessons more than adhering to a curriculum as a result.

Takeaways

Well, the problem is difficult and can seem negative, but what can young people do to tackle mental health concerns during COVID?

The CDC states that to fight stress during COVID, young people need to recognize and address fear, stress, and behavioral changes during COVID. Health concerns are certainly a priority for young people as well, and excessive worry and sadness leads to trouble paying attention, trouble concentrating, and trouble focusing on activities.

It is also important for young people to stay socially connected. Staying socially connected through video chats, Zoom, and phone calls is also a solution.

But honestly, we’re all doing the best we can, and it’s very important to recognize that as we go through our days. Whatever we’re going through is valid and reasonable, and above all, normal.

For me, what’s helped my mental health is spending time with my girlfriend and my friends within reason, limiting how much I doomscroll, and get enough sleep. I try to exercise and maintain a fitness challenge, but what works for me certainly won’t work for everyone.

Unicef emphasizes that it’s important to feel your feelings instead of trying to resist them, as well.

How to Turn Your Popular Blog Series Into a Bestselling Book,"How to Turn Your Popular Blog Series Into a Bestselling Book

Thoughts from someone who’s done it five times

Photo by John Schnobrich on Unsplash

Every serious writer’s dream is to see their name on a bestselling book — one that people eagerly read, review, and tell their friends about.

Is that your dream?

It can come true. Your words can reach further and do more good than you ever imagined.

You’re already here on Medium writing for the masses. Maybe you have a blog, too. I’ll bet you’ve noticed it’s infinitely easier to get traffic here than it is on your own property.

Why is that?

When it’s your own place, you have to invite people to come. They won’t necessarily see you when they’re surfing the web, looking for content like yours. The keywords might bring your site to the top if you’ve done your homework and bought a few (or a lot of) ads. If you’ve got a hefty budget to spend before you make a dime, that can be a great way to go.

But what if you don’t?

Hope for those on a limited budget

When you first start out, you’ve got a big dream. You know your story is good. You know it can change people’s lives. It doesn’t matter if it’s truth or fiction. The truth is, even fiction has a bit of truth in it. If it didn’t, it would be fantasy. We need things to make sense, even in a made up world or we can’t follow what’s happening, much less believe it enough to read it.

I write nonfiction, most of the time, so what I share here will come from that perspective. If you’re a storyteller, there are still principles here you can use to promote your work. So stay with me, okay?

The beauty of writing on a platform like Medium is you don’t have to spend a dime to get paid. You do have to spend time — and we all have some of that. Here’s how you’ll spend it:

Brainstorming ideas

Refining those ideas into drafts

Editing your writing for prime time

Sharing a bit on social media, your own work and the work of others

You can cash in on community when you contribute something valuable to it. The more valuable it is, the more likely others will read it, comment on it, and share it. When you do the same for others, some will want to pay you back.

Generosity is the key to growth.

Write to learn what people want

A book is an ambitious project.

Some say it takes a year or more. Others say you can write a book a week. I’m not sure I advocate either of these approaches.

I say writing a book should take long enough for it to be effective. Depending on your subject and how much time you have, that could take three months or nine months. If you know a lot up front, the process will be shorter. If you have to do a lot of research, budget that time in.

So what makes a book effective? How do you answer that question?

Photo by bruce mars on Unsplash

First, your book is effective when it satisfies a reader’s need.

What do your readers want? If you have a following, you already know, don’t you? They probably want a few things like:

Entertainment

Information

Hope

An escape

Chances are, they want a mix of these things. As you blog, invite your readers to talk to you. Use that feedback to discover what’s missing in their lives that they want more of. Then you can take on the responsibility to provide it to them.

If they feel the need strongly enough, they’ll buy.

Second, your book is effective when it fills a gap.

Don’t just write another leadership book because people buy a lot of them.

The same goes for romance, historical fiction, writing advice, or whatever your speciality is.

Give them something they can’t get anywhere else.

How do you figure out what’s missing?

Read a few other books, preferably the bestsellers. What do they cover? How well do they do it? What might you do even better than this author?

Scan the reviews. Is there something people want that the book doesn’t cover? Is there something people complain about that you can make irrelevant in your book? Read the most popular reviews, positive and negative. Make notes. Then use what you learn to make your book shine.

Talk to people who’ve read these books if you can. Ask them what they liked about them, and what they didn’t. What do they wish the author had covered that he didn’t? What did the author include that they think should have been left out?

Feel free to reward those who help you with a free copy of your awesome book.

Third, test your material in blog posts and refine it in the book.

Before you write your draft in silence and refine it for your book, why not test it with the people who already read your content?

You’ll learn a lot this way:

Whether your readers think your idea is as good as you do

What questions they have about your content

How clearly and persuasively you’re making your points

Wouldn’t you rather know this before you spend a year in front of your desk writing your masterpiece? Better to let it walk in public first before it runs on the digital presses.

If you’re worried people might not buy your book when they can read it online, here’s a bit of insurance to nudge them forward — include some surprises in the book that they can’t get anywhere else.

Also, you don’t have to transfer it word for word if you don’t want to. You’ll probably need to add some transitions so it all flows together. This will become clearer as you work through your blog series.

By the time you’re done, you’ll have a book that already took a test drive before you hit publish. There’s no guarantee you’ll be the number one bestseller, but you’ll sure have a better shot than you will with a book you write on speculation.

When you already have a following, at least some of them will be eager to buy your book on day one.

Finally, it’s not all about you

There are so many people trying to sell something now it’s ridiculous.

And yeah, I know, I’m asking you to be one more of them.

You can set yourself apart by focusing on service. Sure, you’ve gotta get paid. We all need to eat. You soften the blow when you provide more value than what it costs to get that value. People are already spending money on books, courses, and the like. They buy when they believe what they’re getting is more valuable than the cash in their pocket.

When you test drive your book on your blog, you can establish value as you go. Each post should add to the overall value of the total package. With all that going for you, you’ll have no guilt. Marketing won’t feel so slimy. You know your book is good, and you can stand behind it with honest pride.

Make it about them and they’ll make your dream come true.

Do that and I’ll see you on the bestseller list!",https://frankmckinley.medium.com/want-to-turn-your-blog-into-a-book-6360e4b1d670,Frank Mckinley,2020-01-28 03:36:58.566000+00:00,"Books,Entrepreneurship,Writing,Marketing,Productivity"

Dr. Fasial Dar is the pioneer of liver transplantation in Pakistan. He works at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad where he conducted the first ever transplant in 2010 of a 9 year old boy. Recently, along with his team he has successfully completed 200 transplant surgeries in Pakistan.

Fatima Arif: Give us some of your personal background; your family and education background.

Dr. Faisal Dar: I was born in Faisalabad; but due to my father’s death when I was very young; my family decided to move back to our native village, Kotla Bhalot, in

Kharian, District Gujrat. There I completed my basic education from a local school, leading to Matric and F.Sc from Kharian Cantt.

My MBBS is from Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore. After that I completed my FCPS (surgery): Fellow of College of Physicians & Surgeons from Pakistan. Then I went to Ireland for my FRCS (Surgery) Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. This was followed by Fellowship in Liver Transplantation/Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery from Kings College London School of Medicine, UK. Additionally, I am also a Fellow of European Board in Transplant Surgery (FEBTS — Transplant Surgery).

FA: When did you decide to become a doctor, was it a personal choice or like the majority here your parents idea and how did you decide to opt for this specialty?

FD: My family wanted me to join Pakistan Army; becoming a doctor was my own choice. Since I qualified the merit list for medical college; so it was easy to convince my family to let me follow my calling.

Surgery was my passion since the start and that is why after completing my house job I decided to go for my fellowship in general surgery. After completing my training and exams I went to UK for further specialization in 2003. At that time there was no liver transplant and hepatopancreaticobiliary surgeons in Pakistan and considering the huge need for this facility in our country I decided to opt this specialty.

FA: Share your journey of how the liver transplants started and what is the procedure whereby patients are selected?

FD: The first liver transplant in humans was done in 1963. Liver transplant went through two decades of evolution and scientific work, and it was only in 1983 when liver transplant was accepted as the standard treatment for liver failure. Since then huge number of liver transplants are carried out across the world. Living donor liver transplant (in which a healthy individual donates a part of his liver to his beloved one) started in early 1990’s; the techniques and procedures got matured by 2000, and now living donor liver transplant is the standard accepted options for patients with liver failure in countries where donations after brain death does not exists.

After completing my training at King’s College Hospital, London, I decided to come back to Pakistan and start liver transplant program in my country. I was lucky to get good colleagues and tremendous support from the management to get the basic work done before we could do our first liver transplant on 30th April 2010 at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad. Personally it was a very happy and emotional moment and a great honor for me as a doctor to be the pioneer of liver transplantation in Pakistan.

Patients go through an extensive assessment process to determine their candidacy for liver transplant. In short any patient who’s liver has failed either due to a chronic disease (like hepatitis B & C, autoimmune liver diseases etc.) or suffer from acute liver failure (due to hepatitis E, A or other viruses, drugs or toxins) and patients who have developed liver cancer can benefit from liver transplant. Patients who are unfit to go through such a major operation (due to severe heart or lung disease) or patients who have advanced cancer are not considered for liver transplant because they will not benefit in short or long term from liver transplant.

FA: How are patients who can’t afford the procedure included in the process and how is there funding secured?

FD: Liver transplant is one of the most complex operation in the medical field. In order to conduct a liver transplant there are some minimal standards that need to be followed by the hospital. Without these basic set standards and the highest level of skill set it is not possible to do a liver transplant successfully. Someone has to bear the cost of the operation. At the moment majority of the patients pay out of their own pocket. Some are funded by the insurance companies, some by the Government and some by different NGO’s.

Pakistan is a beautiful country. Its natural beauty comprising of landscapes, deserts, rivers, planes and the mighty mountains is matchless. The people of Pakistan are loving and caring, known for their hospitality.

FA: What is the future you see for Pakistan’s medical community in terms of the latest treatments and technology?

FD: Technology is not a big issue as the world has become a global village and access to technology has been made easier. The most important factor is the human resource. Pakistan needs expat doctors to come back; transfer knowledge, techniques and train the future generations to the latest available treatments in the world.

FA: Share one inspiring story that you came across over the period of your career that had a lasting impact on you?

FD: The story that had an impact on me and is close to my heart is from our first liver transplant at Shifa International Hospital. The patient, Muhammad Yasin, a 9 year old boy who was in a need of liver transplant. He was the only son after seven daughters, and none of the family members had a matching blood group for them to donate a part of their liver to save his life. It was his 21 years old cousin; Humaira; a university student who volunteered herself to go through an operation to save her cousin’s life. The courage of this young girl, the bond of the family and the faith they had on us was amazing. It has been three years down the line both, Yasin and Humaira are living a normal life.

FA: Pakistan faces brain drain, specifically in the medical field. What is your take on it and in your opinion what is the solution to this problem?

FD: Personally, I think Pakistani doctors need to go abroad to get exposure to the Western world, that not only enhances their medical knowledge, but it grooms them. Furthermore this exposure adds to their confidence while at the same time teaches them better patient care procedures.

However, I also believe that these doctors after improving their skills should come back and serve Pakistan. A lot of responsibility also lies on the Government to improve the public sector hospitals and to redefine service structure for doctors. If our hospitals are upgraded and the doctors are offered decent salaries, I think a lot of doctors will prefer coming back home.

FA: What is your message to the international community about Pakistan, where you would like to change at least one stereotype about the country and its people?

FD: Pakistan is a beautiful country. Its natural beauty comprising of landscapes, deserts, rivers, planes and the mighty mountains is matchless. The people of Pakistan are loving and caring, known for their hospitality.

Our youth is really talented and determine to work for a better future. There are macro level issues, like corruption, bad governance and terrorism that are the obstacles in the materializing of the country’s true potential. I hope to play whatever role I can to help our younger generation break these shekels and realize their dreams.",https://medium.com/storyfest/dr-faisal-dar-pioneer-of-liver-transplantation-in-pakistan-e6f373cb0ea,Fatima Arif,2019-02-28 06:01:04.914000+00:00,"People,Storyfest,Health,Pakistan,Storytelling"
Sunlight — The Natural Supplement For Our Mental Health,"Sunlight — The Natural Supplement For Our Mental Health

The science behind how the sun is related to our mental wellbeing

Photo by Rampal Singh on Unsplash

Yoga, meditation, binaural beats, aroma therapy. All of these are our attempts at improving our mental health. More than ever, this generation has spoken out about mental health issues and have taken considerable steps in order to try and improve our mental health.

Yet, amongst the many techniques that seem to be popular, it’s surprising that being under the sunlight isn’t something that everybody does.

After all, it’s completely free and can be done easily (at least when it isn’t winter).

Sunlight and Serotonin

Experts often associate exposure to sunlight with the release of serotonin. And this has been proven by science.

A study conducted to find the relationship between serotonin, sunlight, and the season found that the rate of serotonin production is directly related to the prevailing duration of bright sunlight. At the same time, as the luminosity of the sunlight increased, the rate of serotonin production also rose rapidly.

Furthermore, it has been reported in Times that autopsy studies found higher levels of serotonin in individuals that passed away in summer than those who did in winter. This difference in serotonin level was attributed to the differing amounts of sunlight available between the two different seasons.

So… exposure to sunlight is associated with the release of serotonin. But what does that have to do with mental health?

Serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine) is actually a neurotransmitter and is known as the natural ‘feel-good’ chemical. This is due to its role as a natural mood stabilizer and its ability to reduce the symptoms of depression.

As such, by increasing the rate of serotonin production, sunlight acts as a natural mood booster, allowing one to feel happier while reducing the negative effects that are often associated with depression.

In fact, in 2018, a study conducted by Chinese researchers found that moderate exposure to sunlight correlates to an improvement in memory and motor learning in mice. While humans might function differently from mice, this study suggests that a similar relation could be happening for us.

Additionally, results from another study also suggested that exposure to sunlight is associated with the cognitive decline one experiences. In this study, the researchers found that individuals with a decreased exposure of sunlight experienced a higher probability of cognitive decline. This was especially true for individuals with existing depression.

Sunlight and Melatonin

Apart from serotonin, sunlight plays a key role in the release of another chemical — melatonin. However, instead of being produced when it is sunny, melatonin is produced when it is dark. The lower the light intensity, the more melatonin secreted.

While serotonin is a feel-good chemical, melatonin is the natural hormone that promotes sleep in our bodies. As it becomes dark, our body secretes more melatonin in order to prepare us for sleep. This means that melatonin is essential to help us regulate our sleep cycles.

However, there is evidence that suggests that shift workers who work through the night (and as such, are less exposed to sunlight) produce less melatonin. Without this sleep producing hormone, one could possibly experience insomnia and low quality sleep from sleep disturbances.

As quality sleep is key to maintaining a healthy mind, exposing yourself to sunlight can help encourage your body to create melatonin, allowing you to get a good night’s rest (and an improved mental state).

Furthermore, normal melatonin secretion is key to maintaining our bodies’ natural circadian rhythm. As a disruption of the natural circadian rhythm is known to increase the risk of depression, going under the sun to maintain healthy levels of melatonin production could be key in helping you keep depression at bay.

Lack of Sunlight Leaves You SAD

With sunlight playing key roles in the creation of serotonin and melatonin, a lack of sunlight can actually lead to a condition called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).

SAD is actually a form of depression that typically affects individuals during the winter seasons (explaining the lethargy and helplessness you might feel when winter comes). While sunlight is not the only factor, it is suggested that SAD primarily affects individuals in winter as one is less likely to be exposed to strong sunlight. And this points to the importance of sunlight exposure. In order to help reduce the possibility of SAD (especially when it isn’t even winter yet), try your best to expose yourself to natural sunlight as much as possible. Who knows, that might just be the key to helping you keep illnesses like SAD at bay.

Sunlight and Vitamin D

Apart from serotonin and melatonin, sunlight plays a key role in helping our bodies synthesize vitamin D. A fat-soluble vitamin, vitamin D promotes calcium absorption (strengthening your bones) while also supporting the immune system.

A lack of vitamin D in one’s body actually increases the risk of osteoporosis, jaundice, and cardiovascular diseases. As physical well being is tied closely to one’s mental health, getting a healthy dose of vitamin D helps protect your mental wellness by maintaining your physical health.

Besides physical health, vitamin D also has a surprising role in mental health as well. Researchers have found that when one has a vitamin D level of below 20 nanograms per millimeter, the risk of depression is raised by as much as 85 percent when compared to individuals with vitamin D levels of more than 30 nanograms per millimeter).

Studies done also suggest that there is a casual relation between taking vitamin D supplements and an improvement in symptoms for those who suffer from depression. As few foods offer vitamin D naturally, going out into the sun might be the best (and easiest) way to help your body get enough vitamin D.

But How Much Sunlight is Enough?

Of course, we’ve all heard warnings that tell us not to go out into the sun. As sunlight is made up of ultraviolet (UV) rays, experts often warn us about prolonged exposure to strong sunlight.

After all, UV rays damage our skin cells, promoting the formation of blemishes and wrinkles while increasing the risk of skin cancer.

However, Dr. James O’Keefe, a cardiologist who studies the relationship between vitamin D and cardiovascular health, believes that we are evolved to be in the presence of direct sun exposure, claiming that having some direct sunlight helps benefit our health greatly.

In fact, WHO has published guidelines regarding the amount of sunlight exposure we should have. With the beneficial effects of sunlight exposure, WHO suggests getting 5–15 minutes of unblocked (e.g. no sunscreen, no long sleeves) sunlight on our face, arms and hands 2–3 times a week.

With more and more of us spending an increased number of time indoors, going out for occasional sunlight exposure can greatly help improve your mental health.

Of course, as UV rays can still cause your skin harm, do keep your direct sunlight exposure short and avoid periods with strong UV radiation (e.g. noon). If you are going to be out in the sun for an extended period of time, protect yourself with sunscreen. And for those with skin conditions, it might be good to ask your doctor for advice before heading out to bask in the sun.",https://medium.com/wholistique/sunlight-the-natural-supplement-for-our-mental-health-7f59d5fa4492,Jerren Gan,2020-12-16 10:47:37.171000+00:00,"Self Improvement,Mental Health,Health,Wellness,Science"
Occam’s dice,"Occam’s dice

Distrusting biological metaphors

“The aim of science is to seek the simplest explanation of complex facts. We are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple because simplicity is the goal of our quest. The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be ‘Seek simplicity and distrust it.’”

— Alfred North Whitehead

Simplicity is powerful. Economists seek minimal models to describe market fluctuations, and our greatest mathematicians use the guiding light of elegance to discover their next great truths. But is this preference a fundamental reflection of nature’s workings, or an aesthetic one? Occam’s razor — positing that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one — is particularly abused in biology. As Eve Marder has long argued, biological systems are equipped with redundant strategies and contingencies that confound the interpretation of even the most tightly controlled biological experiments. Even the idea of probing a “controlled” biological system merits careful reflection. By controlling for variables, we stray from reality, instead describing an abstract, manipulated system, and often still failing to account for the hundreds of cellular mechanisms we don’t yet know about. (Take, for example, surprising work from Didier Stanier and colleagues, who recently reported that knocking out a gene with CRISPR leads to the expression of homologous genes to compensate for the loss.) In a debate held a decade ago, Richard Dawkins and Lynn Margulis argued about the role of symbiosis in evolutionary theory. An exasperated Dawkins asked: “why on earth would you want to drag in symbiogenesis when it’s so unparsimonious and uneconomical?” Margulis replied: “because it’s there.” Parsimony for parsimony’s sake is not parsimonious in the biosciences.

It’s important to recognize that our formalization of biology is fundamentally historical — philosophers like Hans-Jorg Rheinberger, Bachelard, and others have argued that biology has been primarily technology (rather than hypothesis) driven. The ideas of biology are inextricable from the technology that produces them. As Rheinberger put it: “phenomena and instrument, object and experience, concept and method are all engaged in a running process of mutual instruction.” Our resultant understanding of nature is dominated by our choice of experimental system, which includes our instruments, the model organism, even the culture wherein a discovery is made: the knowledge generated is, in some very real ways, as contingent as the processes it describes. We fit discovered phenomena with simple handles — reduced, for practical purposes, to a sort of currency to be exchanged between labs, resorting to pale metaphors when communicating the natural mysteries.



It’s clear why we do this. It’s in part a heuristic shortcut, making things easier to wrap our heads around. We want to understand nature — we, being individual humans, not as the vague “human collective.” We therefore seek truths comprehensible to a single intellect; and so, as the parable goes, we’re searching for our keys under a streetlamp. Even so, it seems so inherently obvious, so inarguable that true things should be simpler things. The instinct to discover the rules of nature is older than man: the nervous system is biology’s greatest prediction algorithm, and it dutifully learns patterns whose knowledge might enhance its chance of survival (science being the formal application of this impulse). Thus, human thought is underpinned by an unconscious aesthetic laid down in the nervous system itself.

Studies suggest we naturally tend to find satisfaction in simplicity, in learnability (often through repetition)— in that which is easy to process. In music, for example, the most universally enjoyable songs lie somewhere between tedious simplicity (like the worst of pop) and unpredictable entropy (like some modern composers). We’re just acting after our nervous system’s modus operandi when we seek learnable patterns. Maxims that appear to be self-evident — e.g. something along Occam’s logic, “a simpler explanation is better” — may only appear to be so because they’re rewarded within the system that evaluates them. That is, they’re self-reflective: the nervous system, itself effectively a simplifying model of its environment, seeks to uncover patterns that render its existence more manageable. It’s evaluating a reductive internal model against its own implicit function. The mind is a causality inferring machine: the impetus to ascribe linear causal relationships is inbuilt to our nervous system. Armed with this hammer, the whole messy universe looks like an elegant nail.

Of course, ultimately, what we want to do with science is to uncover what Dawkins has referred to as “economically expressed rules.” We are interested in the objects of life primarily because they point us to the process of life. We don’t count the color bands of a beetle for the sake of knowing this fact, but because our understanding of rules often emerges from collections of observations — in the beetle’s case, for example, untangling the logic of developmental programs. But is there even a clear boundary between biological object and process?

For example, it’s often said that biological entities perform computations (we’ll ignore, for the time being, the fact that no one can agree what is meant by computation): the organism an object, and computation its process. In doing so we suppose a separation between software and hardware, algorithm and data. But organisms are also the result of computations: cells can be thought of as “testing hypotheses” during the development of an embryo, for example. Both evolution and nervous systems are the results of computations becoming embodied in the architecture of their computers. Even in machine learning, as Sunderhauf et al. recently argued, “there is a spectrum — rather than a dichotomy — between programming and data.” Indeed, the success of machine learning, despite its inelegance, underscores the fact that simplicity isn’t necessarily a useful goal.

Evolution has never (until, perhaps, soon) operated by reason, but rolls of a die. The resultant systems are rife with feedback loops and interdependencies. Neuroscientists too often conflate observational studies with causal explanations of behaviors, but a description or manipulation of what neurons or networks are active during a behavior is not the explanans of that behavior. ‘Necessary and sufficient’ doesn’t work the way neuroscientists usually use it. Thirty years ago, Randolf DiDomenico and colleagues proposed that we avoid making causal claims in individual papers, and instead build them from multiple studies using various techniques and approaches. Given the sheer complexity of these networks and amount of data we’ve generated, this is increasingly beyond the scope of individual human intellect. All this is to say: think hard about what it is you wish to show with your studies. Be humble in your claims. Pragmatism may be a more holy grail than Truth. Or, as Hemingway (perhaps apocryphally) advised: kill your darlings.

"To Quickly Build Trust, Tell Your Origin Story","Photo credit: Leo Leung

People want to know why you do what you do.

If you’re an entrepreneur, your investors, customers, and employees want to know why you founded your company. Apply for a job, and recruiters ask about your career path. If you’re a freelancer, everyone is curious about how you got started.

Why do we crave origin stories? Because they reveal character. Superman is a good guy because his planet exploded, his parents sent him to Earth, and the Kents raised him to fight evil. Steve Jobs became a trusted CEO, in part, by bouncing back from failure. My dad thrived as a home builder, but only after terminating a partnership with a prominent colleague whose practices he found unethical.

In other words:

Your origin story helps people decide whether or not to trust you.

How to Craft a Powerful Origin Story: The 5 Essential Elements

In strategic messaging and positioning engagements with CEOs, as well as business storytelling workshops for teams, I’ve helped hundreds of people construct origin stories. The best instantly convey not only trustworthiness, but also traits like commitment, persistence, and curiosity.

So what makes a great origin story work?

At the heart of every great origin story is a single event that forever changes the course of the teller’s life. Typically it arises out of failure or disappointment; sometimes it’s an unexpected discovery. Very frequently, another person illuminates a new way forward.

Can you pinpoint the event that set you on your current path? (Yes, we all have one.) The event doesn’t have to be life-changing in the “I won the lottery” sense (though congrats if that happened). It just has to reorient you towards what you’re doing now.

Once you’ve identified your event, construct your origin story around it using the following five components, and tell it in this order:

1. Once upon a time…

How was your life before the life-changing event? Most importantly, what did you want back then? Share relevant details: How old were you? Where did you live? When did this happen? (No, you don’t literally have to start with “Once upon a time…”)

For example, here’s the “Once upon a time…” for my origin story:

Back in the dot-com years, I was living in Manhattan, struggling to fund my startup. It was not going well. One VC attached a hand-written note to his standard rejection letter: “Andy, I rate every business plan I receive on a scale of one to 10. Yours is a one.” At the bottom, he wrote, “P.S. Not a compelling story.”

2. “Then one day…”

Next, describe your life-changing event. If possible, tell this section as a scene with details that the listener can sense (visualize, hear, smell, etc.). Again, here’s mine:

One day, I’m walking up Broadway, when I notice a huge sign in the window of a Barnes and Noble. The sign says, “For anyone who wants to tell a compelling story,” and it’s pointing to a book about screenwriting. I buy the book.

3. “Because of that…”

What relevant events were then set in motion? What obstacles did you have to overcome? Basically, describe what happened next:

That night, I read the book from cover to cover. It’s written in the language of feature films (three act structure, etc.), but much of it seems to apply to telling the story of a startup. I rewrite my pitch and send it to a new batch of investors.

4. “Until finally…”

What was the turning point — the moment when you really committed to the new path? It’s especially effective to reflect here on how you changed and what you learned:

After receiving the revised pitch, several investor groups invite my team to their offices, and four months later we have a term sheet from a prominent Silicon Valley venture firm. The numbers, the team — all remained same. The only thing that changed was how we told our story.

5. “So now…”

Last but not least, describe what you do now, and connect it to the story.

So now I help leadership teams craft strategic messaging and positioning, which is really just their story — the story they use to power fundraising, sales, marketing, recruiting, and product. I also teach storytelling workshops for teams. And I can trace it all back to my failed pitch.

Swap Origin Stories with Others to Quickly Build Stronger Relationships

Once you’ve drafted your own origin story, tell it a few times to see what works. That’s not to say you should introduce yourself to strangers with “Once upon a time...” But if you’re embarking on a relationship with someone new — a customer, a prospect, an investor— and they ask, try it out. Pay particular attention to where they lean in.

Also, ask others to tell you their origin stories. Listen closely, and you’ll quickly learn about their character, values and desires, which can be helpful in all sorts of relationships.

As one woman in my recent General Assembly workshop said after swapping origin stories with a classmate: “There’s something about sharing these stories that makes me feel instantly connected.”",https://medium.com/the-mission/want-trust-share-your-origin-story-78db82157cca,Andy Raskin,2016-07-06 19:45:00.648000+00:00,"Entrepreneurship,Personal Development,Startup,Marketing,Storytelling"

The George R.R. Martin Exercise for Writing Effective Dialogue

At the Neuchâtel Fantastic Film Festival in Switzerland, an interviewer asked fantasy writer George R.R. Martin what qualities are needed to be a good writer.

Among several pieces of advice, Martin stressed the importance of having “a good ear for dialogue and the way people actually speak … the individuality to give each character his own method of speaking.”

Easier said than done, right? Lucky for us, Martin went on to share a writing exercise that can help you sharpen your dialogue skills:

I sometimes teach writing classes. And there are various exercises you can give to students. One of them is to describe a half dozen different characters. Write a speech for each of these different characters without a name tag. Just say, “Here’s a priest, here’s a soldier, here’s a housewife”… Invent whatever you want. Write a speech for each of them in which…they don’t give their name…just make each speech sound different from the other so you can instantly know just from the words this is the priest speaking, this is the prostitute speaking… If they all sound the same, you have a problem. They should sound different.

A bonus tip: make sure to read your dialogue out loud. That’s a fantastic way to test whether your conversations sound authentic.

The Dani Shapiro Exercise for Banishing Writer’s Block

Ever sit down at your computer to begin writing a new short story or a new personal essay, but instead you find yourself having a stare down with the blank screen? You may type a few lines, but after several minutes you delete everything. You just can’t seem to find the right words to continue.

New York Times bestselling-author Dani Shapiro has the perfect writing prompt for you. In an interview, she shared two words that instantly help banish writer’s block,

My favorite prompt is based on a book that was published a long time ago by a writer named Joe Brainard, and the title is ‘I Remember’…In the book every single sentence begins with the phrase, “I remember.” …When I give that exercise at retreats, I look out from where I’m sitting at a sea of people, and not one of them hesitates. Those are extremely evocative words. I mean, try not to finish a sentence that begins with “I remember.” And so what I suggest to people to do is to just begin — have a special notebook, begin with the words “I remember” and write a sentence. Drop down a line, begin with [“I remember”], not trying to connect memories. If you think about the way memory works, it doesn’t work in a narrative line. It doesn’t connect. We don’t tell ourselves stories in our heads. We have these disparate memories that don’t connect. And when we allow them to be associative and to bounce one off the next, it creates all sorts of interesting material. People almost invariably find memories that they didn’t know that they had, or they make connections that they didn’t know they had. So it’s a good springing off point.

You can use this prompt to spark ideas for anything from blog posts to short stories. I share more strategies for fighting writer’s block in my article here, and I share tips for getting ideas for new blog posts in my article here.

The Robert McKee Exercise For Writing With Originality

Robert McKee’s screenwriting workshops have earned him an international reputation. His screenwriting students have included over sixty-five Academy Award winners and two hundred Emmy Award winners.

I’m currently rereading his wonderful book Story where he deep dives into everything that you need to know to write powerful stories. In one chapter, he discusses the importance of originality in storytelling and how clichés make our writing shallow and boring. He writes,

The source of all clichés can be traced to one thing and one thing alone: The writer does not know the world of his story… As they reach into their minds for material, they come up empty. So where do they run? To films and TV, novels and plays with similar settings. From the works of other writers they crib scenes we’ve seen before, paraphrase dialogue we’ve heard before, disguise characters we’ve met before, and pass them off as their own… Knowledge of and insight into the world of your story is fundamental to the achievement of originality and excellence.

But how can we come to know the world of our stories better?

Here’s one exercise McKee provides:

Lean back and ask, “What would it be like to live my character’s life hour by hour, day by day?” In vivid detail sketch how your characters shop, make love, pray — scenes that may or may not find their way into your story, but draw you into your imagined world until it feels like déjà vu. While memory gives us whole chunks of life, imagination takes fragments, slivers of dream, and chips of experience that seem unrelated, then seeks their hidden connections and merges them into a whole. Having found these links and envisioned the scenes, write them down. A working imagination is research.

The Brian Kiteley Exercise for Writing Unique, Sensory Descriptions

Finally, let’s end with an exercise that will help us write unique, sensory descriptions so our writing comes alive.

The ability to describe something vividly is an essential skill for every writer to master, no matter whether you’re a blogger, novelist, or copywriter. Vivid descriptions transform your paragraphs from vague and boring to engrossing and memorable.

In his book The 3 A.M. Epiphany, author Brian Kiteley shares a collection of “uncommon writing exercises” that can help you transform your fiction.

Here’s one that gives a unique approach for writing evocative descriptions:

Synesthesia, according to M.H. Abrams in ‘A Glossary of Literary Terms’, is a description of “one kind of sensation in terms of another; color is attributed to sounds, odor to colors, sound to odors, and so on.” Here is an example of synesthesia from Bruno Schulz’s Street of the Crocodiles: “Adela would plunge the rooms into semidarkness by drawing down the linen blinds. All colors immediately fell an octave lower; the room filled with shadows, as if it had sunk to the bottom of the sea and the light was reflected in mirrors of green water.” Schulz describes a change in color by means of a musical term. Writers consciously and unconsciously employ this peculiar method to convey the irreducible complexity of life onto the page. …Use synesthesia in a short scene — surreptitiously, without drawing too much attention to it — to convey to your reader an important understanding of some ineffable sensory experience. Use sight, sound, touch, taste, and, especially, smell.

In my short story “The Island”, I played with synesthesia when I described the aroma of a pastry baking in an oven: “It smelled of sunlight and warm breezes rustling the branches of island trees.”

Make sure to check out this article where I share three more techniques that will help you write vivid descriptions.

The Takeaway

In my original article where I shared five writing exercises, I also shared this quote from Ray Bradbury,

I know you’ve heard it a thousand times before. But it’s true — hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice.

These four exercises are a fantastic way to give your writing skills and imagination a workout.

Facing Three Fundamental Coronavirus Fears,"1. Since immunity to the novel coronavirus may not last long, doesn’t the virus need to be eradicated in order for the pandemic to end?

Humans generally become immune to a pathogen after immunization or recovery from an infection. Depending on the particular disease or vaccine as well as host characteristics such as the age and health of the individual, immunity can last a lifetime or may be short-lived. Moreover, immunity is not an ‘either/or’ process. Our immunity to different pathogens doesn’t just suddenly switch off. Instead, it wanes over time.

It is true that a person’s immunity to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, probably only lasts a few months to a few years. It is also true that outbreaks of two other coronaviruses earlier this century, SARS and MERS, were indeed contained, although not technically eradicated. However, the other four known human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1, are considered endemic. These viruses, which have been around longer than the other three, are continuously circulating through the population and typically cause no more symptoms than the common cold.

Interestingly, there is historical evidence that the four endemic coronaviruses were likely the cause of pandemics, or at least epidemics, in the past. Of course, this would have been long enough ago that people didn’t know what a coronavirus was, but humankind managed to recover anyway. These older coronaviruses now permeate among the population. People often become exposed at a young age, and, as with SARS-CoV-2, the vast majority of children have no symptoms or a minor respiratory infection. Even though immunity to these viruses diminishes over time, because they are endemic and continuously circulate through the population, every few years our immune systems are again exposed and receive a refresher course on how to kill the virus.

With possible exception to geographically isolated locations like Iceland and New Zealand, SARS-CoV-2 is on a path to becoming endemic like its older endemic coronavirus siblings. In fact, since March, for most regions containment has no longer been a strategy for managing SARS-CoV-2 as it was during the previous SARS and MERS outbreaks. SARS and MERS have a higher fatality rate than Covid-19, and it is for that very reason they were able to be contained. Since patients infected with SARS and MERS were more often symptomatic, generally developed more severe symptoms, and had a shorter period of time between exposure and the onset of symptoms, cases were recognized sooner, contacts were more easily traced, and further spread was prevented through quarantining.

“The coronavirus is spreading too rapidly, and too broadly for the U.S. to bring it under control with testing and contact tracing.” — Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC Deputy Director, 6/29/20

While contact tracing and quarantining strategies remain important during the Covid-19 pandemic, they are aimed at protecting vulnerable groups and reducing the overall transmission of the virus rather than ultimately containing or eradicating the virus. At this point eliminating SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is essentially impossible. Fortunately, however, as was the case with the four endemic coronaviruses, eradication is not a requirement for the pandemic to end.",https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/facing-three-fundamental-fears-about-the-coronavirus-261ba270f402,Bo Stapler,2020-08-11 19:37:46.296000+00:00,"Health,Science,Wellness,Coronavirus,Covid 19"
"For Creatives, Silence Isn’t Always Golden","As an architect and the author of a book about the psychology of creative space design, I have long wondered why contemporary creatives cluster so willingly in noisy coffee shops. Granted, there’s scientific research that caffeine fuels the imagination, but doesn’t the surrounding din interfere with their ability to think creatively such that no amount of chemical stimulation can compensate for the distraction?

Certainly, many eminent creatives from the past shunned clamor. Consider Marcel Proust. To remark that the French writer was sensitive to auditory interference would be an understatement. The man was positively neurotic about it. He treated the bedroom in his Paris apartment where he wrote like a sensory deprivation chamber — shutters closed, drapes drawn, the walls lined with sound-absorbing cork. It wasn’t enough. He wore earplugs too.

Anton Chekhov was similarly beset by hypersensitivity to sound. So was fellow obsessive Frank Kafka, who described his condition in his signature surreal style by saying that “I need solitude for my writing; not ‘like a hermit’ — that wouldn’t be enough — but like a dead man.” Sadly, by the time he got his wish, it was too late to do anything about it.

The correlation between high-level inventiveness and difficulty in filtering out sensory inputs is understandable, given that open-mindedness is a hallmark of the creative personality. The problem for off-the-chart geniuses like Proust, Chekhov, and Kafka was that their minds were a bit too open. Everything got through. Hence the extreme measures they took to avoid being immobilized by incoming stimuli.

Fig. 1: Optimal noise levels for creative processing compared to other conditions. After Ravi Mehta, Rui (Juliet) Zhu, and Amar Cheema (2012). Illustration by the author. From My Creative Space: How to Design Your Home to Stimulate Ideas and Spark Innovation.

Then again, most of us aren’t Marcel Proust. According to research data from 2012, people generally reach peak performance under moderately noisy conditions — 70db (decibels), to be precise. It just so happens that this is roughly equivalent to the chatter in a typical coffee shop or restaurant on a relatively busy day (Fig. 1).

As to why this is the case, the scientists who authored the study offer a theory:

We theorize that a moderate (vs. low) level of ambient noise is likely to induce processing disfluency or processing difficulty, which activates abstract cognition and consequently enhances creative performance. A high level of noise, however, reduces the extent of information processing, thus impairing creativity.

Translation: silence isn’t as golden as it sounds. Absolute noiselessness tends to focus our attention, which is helpful for tasks that entail accuracy, fine detail, and linear reasoning, such as balancing our checkbook or fixing a Swiss watch. It’s less supportive of the broad, big-picture, abstract mind-wandering that leads to fresh perspectives and a creative work product. On the other hand, excessive noise overwhelms our sensory apparatus and hinders our ability to properly process information at all. In between lies the sweet spot — noise not so loud that we can’t hear ourselves think, and not so quiet that we can’t help but hear ourselves think.

There’s a caveat to the data, however: the noise has to be white. For the record, the technical definition of white noise is noise containing multiple frequencies with equal intensities. More colloquially, the phrase refers to a constant background noise, especially one that drowns out other sounds, and which takes the form of meaningless or distracting commotion, hubbub, or chatter.

Why is it important that the noise be white? Because otherwise you’re prone to tune into and attempt to discern the source and meaning of the sound, which diverts too much of your conscious attention from your task to be a useful tool for diffuse thinking.

How to Make Noise When There Isn’t Any

How can we creative mortals who don’t care for the smell of coffee, lack the funds to construct an oceanside villa, or live in urban environments where trees are scant benefit from the finding that a particular type and level of noise can promote insights? Here are a few options to consider:

Get the app. Yes, Virginia, there really is an app for everything. Use the search term “noise” to bring up dozens of sound generating programs in your smartphone’s app store. You’ll also see a broad selection of metering apps for measuring decibel levels at home.

Some of the app companies operate websites that let you download audio files of white noise soundtracks onto your computer or play them directly through a browser. A couple of my favorite sites include Raining.fm, which offers tracks simulating — what else? — downpours, rolling thunder, and heavy thunderstorms, and Coffitivy, which specializes in — what else? — coffee shop buzz.

Get or hack a sound generator. Another option is to purchase a desktop appliance designed to emit white noise. They’re smallish devices, typically placed on night tables and in babies’ rooms to help occupants fall asleep. For an architectural solution, think about installing an indoor or outdoor fountain — few things in life are as pleasantly hypnotizing as the mellifluous whoosh of water descending onto water. Price points run the gamut from low-cost store-bought products to sky’s-the-limit custom installations.

DIY contrivances also abound; consult the Internet for guidance.

Let in or keep out external noise. City dwellers and people who reside along busy highways might have a ready-made noise machine right outside their window: road traffic. Open your windows to varying degrees or use sound muffling, such as drapery, to see if you can calibrate ambient noise to fall within the optimal range.

A less cacophonous strategy for harnessing exterior sounds would be to park yourself on a bench or beach that lies within earshot of ocean waves. It’s like having an always-on fountain, only bigger.

Listen to music. Like noise, music can have a positive effect on idea formation, while affording the listener far greater pleasure than the usual restaurant ruckus. But music is a huge subject in itself, and so must wait for another article!",https://medium.com/the-creative-mind/for-creatives-silence-isnt-always-golden-16e1697ea489,Donald M.

This 10-Minute Routine Will Increase Your Clarity And Creativity,"“Your subconscious mind works continuously, while you are awake, and while you sleep.” — Napoleon Hill

Your subconscious never rests and is always on duty because it controls your heartbeat, blood circulation, and digestion. It controls all the vital processes and functions of your body and knows the answers to all your problems.

What happens on your subconscious level influences what happens on your conscious level. In other words, what goes on internally, even unconsciously, eventually becomes your reality. As Hill further states, “The subconscious mind will translate into its physical equivalent, by the most direct and practical method available.”

Consequently, your goal is to direct your subconscious mind to create the outcomes you seek. Additionally, you want to tap into your subconscious mind to unlock connections and solutions to your problems and projects.

Here’s a simple routine to get started:

Ten minutes before going to sleep:

“Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious.” — Thomas Edison

It’s common practice for many of the world’s most successful people to intentionally direct the workings of their subconscious mind while they’re sleeping.

How?

Take a few moments before you go to bed to meditate on and write down the things you’re trying to accomplish.

Ask yourself loads of questions related to that thing. In Edison’s words, make some “requests.” Write those questions and thoughts down on paper. The more specific the questions, the more clear will be your answers.

While you’re sleeping, your subconscious mind will get to work on those things.

Ten minutes after waking up:

Research confirms the brain, specifically the prefrontal cortex, is most active and readily creative immediately following sleep. Your subconscious mind has been loosely mind-wandering while you slept, making contextual and temporal connections. Creativity, after all, is making connections between different parts of the brain.

In a recent interview with Tim Ferriss, Josh Waitzkin, former chess prodigy and tai chi world champion, explains his morning routine to tap into the subconscious breakthroughs and connections experienced while he was sleeping.

Unlike 80 percent of people between the ages of 18–44 who check their smartphones within 15 minutes of waking up, Waitzkin goes to a quiet place, does some meditation and grabs his journal.

In his journal, he thought-dumps for several minutes. Thus, rather than focusing on input like most people who check their notifications, Waitzkin’s focus is on output. This is how he taps into his higher realms of clarity, learning, and creativity — what he calls, “crystallized intelligence.”

If you’re not an experienced journal writer, the idea of “thought-dumping” may be hard to implement. In my experience, it’s good to loosely direct your thought-dumping toward your goals.

Consider the “requests” you made of your subconscious just before going to bed. You asked yourself loads of questions. You thought about and wrote down the things you’re trying to accomplish.

Now, first thing in the morning, when your creative brain is most attuned,after its subconscious workout while you slept, start writing down whatever comes to mind about those things.

I often get ideas for articles I’m going to write while doing these thought-dumps. I get ideas about how I can be a better husband and father to my three foster children. I get clarity about the goals I believe I should be pursuing. I get insights about people I need to connect with, or how I can improve my current relationships.

To be sure, you’ll need to practice this skill. It may take several attempts before you become proficient. But with consistency, you can become fluent and automatic at achieving creative and intuitive bursts.

Conclusion:

“A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.” — James Allen

Mental creation always precedes physical creation. Before a building is physically constructed, there’s a blueprint.

Your thoughts are the blueprint of the life you are building one day at a time.When you learn to channel your thinking — both consciously and subconsciously — you create the conditions that make the achievement of your goals inevitable.

You are the designer of your destiny.

The Ted Talk That Changed My Life,"The Simplest Form of Mindfulness Is Also the Most Effective

Most of us are cognitively aware that our bad habits are, well, BAD. The challenge is that our prefrontal cortex (front section of the brain) that is responsible for this awareness is the first to go offline when we get stressed. When this brain center logs off, we start to feel ‘numb’, give in to our stress, and fall back onto negative habits.

Let’s go back to the 3 pillars that form a habit one more time. You experience a trigger. You respond with a behavior. You receive a reward.

Say you’re battling the urge to have that fourth slice of pizza. You’ve already experienced the trigger that’s telling you, “Yes, this is a great idea…you’ll feel so good after”. What if we took a split second here to pause before caving in? What if we were to use curiosity as a tool to disrupt the cycle? Here’s what it looks like:

You feel a trigger that spurs temptation. Instead of caving in, you pause for a moment and get curious. Ask yourself…what’s going on? Why am I feeling this way?

From here you have two possible routes, both of which are a step in the right direction. The first path is that you still give in to your bad behavior, but with a heightened state of mindfulness. The act of caving in feels much less satisfying. You become consciously aware that the reward is just a guise covering up the reality that you’re in an endless loop of going nowhere.

In one of Brewers’s studies, a subject involved with smoking admitted that mindful smoking, “smells like stinky cheese, and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!”. This paper eventually reveals that mindfulness training may confer benefits greater than those associated with current standard treatments for smoking cessation. No money, drugs, or therapy required.

The second route is when things get really exciting. This is when you experience the trigger, but you’re now inherently aware that this is a poor choice and you take a halt.

This is how you move from knowledge to wisdom. We’re all cognitively aware that bad habits aren’t good for us. Curiosity bridges the gap to allow us to be mindful of this, even when we’re stressed out or ‘in the act’.

When you start to implement this curiosity technique into your behaviors, bad habits simply become less enchanting. You start to wise up and realize that you don’t need to give in to every trigger that comes your way. An amazing bonus to this mindset is that curiosity in itself is rewarding. Being mindful amidst your stressed-out state will deliver the prize that you were initially seeking from your ‘drug’ of choice. It may not be as powerful of a hit, but over time, your brain will realize that it’s the one you need.

This is a rewarding, sustainable, and life-changing way to think about human behavior. Will it solve all of your problems instantly? Absolutely not. Many addictions are as much physiological as they are psychological. At times, it may be necessary to get professional help. Regardless, this is a powerful tool for initiating an important conversation with yourself. It is one that empowers you to ditch the dissociation and start attacking your bad habits head-on.",https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/the-ted-talk-that-changed-my-life-a79e591783bf,David Liira,2020-12-11 23:20:21.853000+00:00,"Lifestyle,Health,Wellness,Science,Psychology"
How to Make Your Day Job Support Your Art,"Gather around kids and let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, people grew up and got one job that paid all of their bills, let them save some money, and was enough to do big things like buy a house and put their kids through college.

Once upon a time, that was just what happened. It’s sometimes called the American Dream, but it was just reality. Weird, I know. For the rest of this post I’m going to talk about a day job, but what I mean is whatever income streams you’ve cobbled together to pay for your life.

And even weirder if you’re an artist of any kind who has it in their head that you’re supposed to figure out how to make your art give you that kind of life.

The idea that your art has to be the kind of pillar of your financial life that that barely even exists in the corporate world anymore is a dream killer.

You aren’t a failure if your art doesn’t let you quit your day job.

One more time for the people who really need to hear it.

You aren’t a failure if your art doesn’t let you quit your day job.

And that day job? It will suck a lot less if you can wrap your head around the idea that it’s serving your art.

Seriously. If you can make yourself believe that the idea that showing up for your 9-to-5 is part of your art, it will change everything.

It will knock your day job off its pedestal and it will relieve your art of the pressure to pay its own way. And it will crack your brain open so that the idea of building a living around your art, instead of feeling like a failure if your art doesn’t pull in enough money all by itself, can take root.

Start by prioritizing your art.

If you have a regular job, chances are there are hours in your day that you don’t have control over. That’s okay. We ALL have hours during the day we don’t have control over.

Even full-time artists who earn a living with their art.

Get a calendar though, an agenda of some kind, and schedule your art like it’s important enough for you to show up for. If you wouldn’t blow off working for someone else, don’t blow off working on your art.

Here’s the deal: you don’t have to put eight hours a day into it. But I bet you can find an hour a day, five days a week. Start there. Write it in and protect that time like there’s a boss who will dock your check if you don’t show up.

Think outside the 9-to-5 box.

Brainstorm how you can make your day job work around your art, instead of the other way around.

Are there income streams you can build that will let you work fewer hours?

Can you find work that will free up more of your emotional and physical energy for your art?

How about focusing on finding a job that pays more per hour so that you can make the same money in fewer hours, and open up time for your art?

Is there some aspect of your art that you can turn into an income? Think about teaching, blogging, freelancing.

Instead of fitting your art into your day job, shift your thinking so that you’re building a life around your art.

Build an audience.

A couple of years ago I set up a little corner of a shared booth at a tiny local comic con to spread the word about Ninja Writers.

I was surrounded by artists of all stripes. Writers. Comic book creators. A girl who made tote bags out of Doctor Who and Star Wars fabric. A man who sat in his booth all day and drew superheroes.

I sat there with my little poster promising to give away a $25 Amazon gift card to one of people who gave me their email address — and I realized that literally no one else around me was collecting email addresses.

A few passed out postcards or bookmarks with their website addresses. Those disappeared into bags full of similar ephemera. I talked to as many as I could and tried to encourage them to collect email addresses from the people who were stopping to talk to them.

I handed out my business card and told them that I’d be happy to help them learn how to build an email list if they emailed me.

It didn’t work. The few people who did take my business card didn’t use it to contact me. I haven’t heard from any of them.

Artists need audiences.

It doesn’t matter what your art is. Writing, painting, sculpture, theater, making TARDIS tote bags. If you are an artist of any kind, you need an audience.

I can tell you from experience that even having some big producer of your art get involved does not guarantee you an audience. Ask anyone whose had a film flop, an art show fail to result in sales, a restaurant go bust.

Ask me sometime about how being published by Penguin worked out for me.

Artists need audiences, and no one else will build them for us. When you are ready to make the move to making some of your income from your art, you’ll need people who care about what you’re doing.

The one thing you can do is start building an email list. Get a free MailChimp account. Or just start writing names and emails in a notebook. Send everyone two emails a month. In one talk about cool shit you’ve come across that you think they might like. In the other talk about what you’re working on.

Make a habit of asking everyone if they want to join your list. It’ll feel weird at first, but you’ll get used to it.

Your day job is the first investor in your art.

True story.

If you have a day job that pays your bills, then it’s paying for your supplies, it’s putting a roof over your head, it’s feeding you. Maybe it’s paying for you to take some classes so you can learn to be a better artist.

Seriously. Your day job is like having patron. Sure you have to work for it. You have to put in the time to get the pay check. And maybe that sucks. I’ve had jobs that really, really sucked. I know that place.

When you have a day job like that, sometimes the only thing that helps is shifting your mindset.

Instead of: I can’t be a writer because I have to work 40 hours a week at this shitty job that I hate and it sucks all my creative energy.

Try this: I spend 40 hours a week at a shitty job that I hate, but it pays for me to spend 20 hours a week writing.

Or even better: I’m grateful for this day job that pays my bills so that I can be a writer.

Give your art a break.

The best gift you can give yourself as an artist is to stop expecting your art to support itself. Especially if you’re still learning.

Maybe your art will earn a living someday. It’s unreasonable to put that burden on it when it’s still a baby venture and you’re still learning how to create it.

I know so many writers who put everything inside them into writing a book. They shine it up and send it off to agents — as they should. And when rejection comes — as it always will — they are crushed. Absolutely devastated.

So devastated that sometimes they just stop writing. What’s the point if it’s never going to make money? Obviously, if this one book failed then they suck and they just aren’t really writers anyway.

Don’t do that to yourself. Please.

Embrace your day job. It has one job. Paying your bills. Let your writing (or whatever your art is) off the hook. Just create. Practice. Take in the masters. Learn to be better.

Come back and talk to me when you’re ten books in about whether or not you should pack it in.",https://medium.com/the-write-brain/how-to-make-your-day-job-support-your-art-2529d75e8375,Shaunta Grimes,2019-09-22 21:16:07.226000+00:00,"Work,Productivity,Creativity,Entrepreneurship,Writing"
Exploring New York City Restaurants,"By Rashida Kamal and Vivien Ngo

Enigma’s latest project Food for Thought provides an interactive interface to explore health inspection data for restaurants across New York City. We dug a little deeper into the relationships between these inspection scores and how popular restaurants are with New Yorkers to highlight a few hidden gems, as well as the places to avoid.

Click an image to play with the full-sized interactive map!

Methodology

Each map contains geocoded Yelp data on restaurant ratings and prices and restaurant inspection data from Enigma Public. Data analysis was done using Pandas, and histograms were made with Matplotlib with Adobe Illustrator for touching up. Restaurants shown with a “?” were inspected but did not receive a letter grade; for our analysis we used the violations score from the most recent inspection even if a grade was not issued. The interactives were designed by Enigma’s previous data journalism fellow, Rashida Kamal, and the maps were updated with June data by Vivien Ngo. Lots of thanks to Peter Henderson for his help!

"A Social Worker Offered Mormon Lingo to Me When I Was in Crisis, Told Me to Think Happy Thoughts, and Hung Up on Me — While I Was Still in Crisis","A Social Worker Offered Mormon Lingo to Me When I Was in Crisis, Told Me to Think Happy Thoughts, and Hung Up on Me — While I Was Still in Crisis Rhett Wilkinson Follow May 26, 2019 · 3 min read

I called a crisis line. You may say it was tragically less than helpful. In fact, it only made the situation worse. The issue was created by a social worker on the other end of the Utah County Crisis Line.

(United Way of Utah County)

Immediately after telling her I am considering killing myself, this person talked about “the other side.”

I’m not against talk about heaven, but “the other side” comes ripped from language used in culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Which still would not be bad, except that she is not speaking organically. Not from the heart. When I was suicidal.

Further, she did nothing more than parrot what the system she is in fed her.

And that’s what she had to offer above anything else when I wanted nothing more than to die.

Then she went on to talk about thinking positive thoughts. I do know social work well enough that least to know that simply thinking positive thoughts doesn’t help anyone depressed, let alone suicidal. And in fact, that patients should be encouraged to grieve. (Not to say that she said nothing about medications or even exercise, let alone yoga.)

(Perhaps this photo expresses Latter-day Saint culture well.) A crisis worker offered Mormon lingo immediately after I told her I was considering killing myself and proceeded to give an idea prevalent in LDS culture about thinking “positive thoughts.”

Another example of her just parroting an idea fed to her by culture, instead of doing the work of life-saving.

So then I got at these ideas. I said that I had compassion for how she was handling the call since her thoughts are not her own since she is part of a cult. Her response?

Hang up.

On someone who may kill themselves?

And she said she has been a social worker for 15 years.

How often, then, did she miss out on helping folks in real pain? How much did she simply drop the ball? Has she fallen short for years?

Perhaps this is why the recording to start the call to the Utah County Crisis Line emphasizes that the social workers are volunteering.

Perhaps, though, even those not getting paid should be kept from life-saving circumstances if they are going to drop the ball so bad.

The Utah County Crisis Line has a tagline of “Let us be your lifeline.” Hopefully at least not this lady any longer.

Even if you no longer affiliate with the Latter-day Saint (ex-Mormon) church but enjoy sociality with family and friends as before, you can still find social settings organized by the Utah Valley PostMormons. There, you can find your people. And of course, if you don’t enjoy those relationships like before, the many UVPM events that happen each week can be even life-saving.

Led by wonderful people, UVPM is also for folks who just are struggling with it or are “never Mormons” seeking a break from the predominant culture. Find their events on Facebook and Meetup.

An Effective Five-Step Process for Writing Captivating Headlines,"You’ve spent hours pouring your heart and soul into a blog post.

You’re writing about an important topic that you’re sure will help readers, and you want to convey your message as effectively as possible.

So you’ve edited each paragraph until your eyes ached from staring at the computer screen. You’ve crafted a compelling introduction that will entice readers to keep reading, and your conclusion is powerful with a memorable final sentence.

Unfortunately, however, all of this time and effort will go to waste if no one reads your article.

Often, there’s only one way to get people to read: you must craft a headline that is so irresistible it draws people like a magnet to click on your piece.

People’s social media feeds are flooded with a constant stream of articles and online content. If you don’t have an attention-grabbing headline, your post won’t reach the potential readers it could help and inspire.

But don’t worry!

In today’s article, I’m sharing my five-step process that will help you write captivating headlines so your target audience reads your valuable blog posts.

Let’s dive in.

(Please note that links to books are affiliate links which means I’ll earn a small commission if you buy through the link with no extra cost to you.)

1. Craft a one sentence synopsis

When I begin working on a new writing project, the very first thing I do is write up a one-sentence synopsis of what my piece will be about. I do this no matter if I’m about to write a blog post, a personal essay, or even a short story.

The one-sentence synopsis gives me a clear understanding of the main point of my piece and the message I’m trying to express to my readers. It acts as a guide so I don’t end up running off on tangents and going down rabbit trails.

And often it can be tweaked to become a perfect title for the piece too.

For example, for this article my synopsis was: “My five-step process that will help readers craft captivating headlines.”

I tweaked that sentence to get my headline: “A Powerful Five-Step Process for Writing Captivating Headlines.”

Now, as I said, I don’t only use the one-sentence synopsis for blog posts. I recently wrote a personal essay titled “What a Museum Security Guard Taught Me About Art.” That title came straight from a one-sentence synopsis I’d crafted too.

In my article here, I dive deeper into how to craft a one-sentence synopsis and share five different formulas that can help you write yours.

Let’s now see how to go about tweaking your synopsis in order to turn it into a powerful headline.

2. Identify Your SEO Keyword

My second step when crafting a headline for a blog post is to identify the keyword that I want my blog post to be categorized under in Google searches.

In blogging parlance, this is called “search engine optimization” or SEO. If you have a blog and don’t bother at all about SEO, you probably won’t end up reaching readers who might have found you through Google.

Even if you’re not worried about SEO, choosing a clear keyword will help people better understand what your piece is about and help you avoid titles that sound like clickbait.

For example, compare the difference between titling your piece “This One Habit Changed My Life” (sounds a bit like clickbait) or “How Journaling in the Morning Changed My Life”. “Journaling” would be your keyword for that title.

Here’s how to figure out what keyword to use for your piece:

Take a look at your one-sentence synopsis. What is your piece about?

Is there a word you use multiple times in your piece to refer to your topic?

What terms might someone be searching for in Google to find your piece?

Search for blog posts similar to yours. What keywords are used in the titles?

3. Tweak Your Headline to Include Specificity, Curiosity, and Power Words

Once I’ve crafted my one-sentence synopsis, written my blog post, and then pinpointed my keyword, I write up a quick first draft of a headline to work with.

Let’s take, for example, the blog post I wrote about my two different journaling methods. A rough draft of a title might have looked like this: “A Peek At My Two Journaling Methods.”

That’s not very compelling, right?

It’s time to tweak that headline to make sure it stands out and entices people to click to read the article.

There are three ingredients that copywriters use to write effective headlines: specificity, curiosity, and power words.

First, specificity makes your headline focused and compelling. In his classic book Scientific Advertising, copywriter Claude C. Hopkins explained why “specificity” is persuasive:

“…[A] man who makes a specific claim is either telling the truth or a lie. People do not expect an advertiser to lie … The weight of an argument may often be multiplied by making it specific.”

Now, you’re probably not selling a product in your blog post, but you most likely are trying to convince your readers of an idea or to take a certain course of action. Specificity will increase your credibility.

For example, instead of writing, “I Lost Weight on a Low Carb Diet”, you could write “How I Lost Five Pounds in Two Weeks on a Low Carb Diet.”

That word “how” indicates your blog post is going to share a specific process you followed. The numbers make your headline sound truthful.

Of course, you’ll lose your credibility if the body of your post doesn’t deliver what the headline promised. If your headline promises to share a specific process, make sure you do so in the body of your post.

Here are ways to make your headlines specific:

Start your headline with a number (for example, “5 Steps to Quickly Memorize Any Piano Piece”)

Start your headline with words like “who, what, why, when, where, or how” (for example, “How to Make A Perfect Pan Seared Steak Every Time”)

Use specific words like “This” or “These” (for example, “This Powerful Strategy Will Boost Your Productivity”)

Use specific numbers in the body of your headline (for example, one of my most popular posts on Medium is “How to Make Your Writing Captivating with One Simple Technique”)

Specificity also piques readers’ curiosity, which is the next ingredient for strengthening your headline.

If a headline arouses a person’s curiosity, they’re probably going to keep reading. So make sure you don’t just summarize your piece in the headline.

For example, I’m not piquing someone’s curiosity if I write a title like this: “Keeping a Journal Will Make You More Productive”.

Compare it to this one: “5 Reasons Why Keeping a Journal Will Make You More Productive”.

Finally, take your headline to the next level by using power words.

Power words are words that trigger an emotional response. They might be a strong adjective or adverb or a more descriptive verb.

For example, instead of writing, “increase your productivity”, you could write, “boost your productivity” or even “supercharge your productivity.”

In my headlines, I use words like “compelling” and “captivating.” A food blogger might use words like “refreshing”, “tasty”, or “delicious.”

When you evaluate your headline, ask yourself if you could include a vivid adjective or a more emotional verb.

4. Convey a benefit to the reader

Lastly, your headline should appeal to the reader’s self-interest. It should promise them something in return for the time they spend reading.

David Ogilvy, known as The Father of Advertising, is said to have stated,

“The headlines that work best are those that promise the reader a benefit.”

A benefit could be anything from entertaining someone to teaching someone to inspiring someone to helping someone solve a problem.

What is the benefit you’re offering to a person for reading your blog post?

Will you help them solve a problem? Earn money? Save money? Increase their productivity? Expand their knowledge? Become smarter? Happier? Avoid danger?

Maybe they will learn a quick and effortless method for accomplishing something? Or discover a secret or a strategy?

Depending on the type of blog post you’re writing, you might want the promise in your headline to be very clear or perhaps more subtle. For example, my personal essay’s title “What a Museum Security Guard Taught Me About Art” was focused on me rather than on the reader. However, it did promise that I was going to share the security guard’s wisdom with them.

But when I wrote the headline for my blog post about my journaling methods, I wanted the benefit to be very clear. I decided to go with “Two Journaling Methods to Boost Your Productivity and Creativity” rather than “Two Journaling Methods That Boost My Productivity and Creativity.” The latter is not as powerful at hooking the reader.

5. Write Multiple Headlines

Even the best copywriters in the world usually don’t write a captivating headline right off the bat. In the book Tested Advertising Methods, expert copywriter John Caples says he writes between twelve to twenty-five headlines before choosing the best one.

Sometimes I will change the headline of a post after I’ve published it if I notice that it isn’t getting a lot of clicks.

So experiment and tweak your headlines as much as you can. Write out a list of different headlines you can use for your piece.

Headline formulas are a fantastic way to remind yourself to include all of the essential copywriting elements covered in steps 3 and 4. You can find these formulas in copywriting books or in countless articles online. Here are several examples:

How to Start____When____ (For example, “How to Start a Side Hustle When You’re Broke”)

(For example, “How to Start a Side Hustle When You’re Broke”) Why____Makes You____ (“Why Reading Makes You a Better Writer”)

(“Why Reading Makes You a Better Writer”) [Number] Mistakes People Make When____ (“10 Mistakes People Make When Saving for Retirement”)

(“10 Mistakes People Make When Saving for Retirement”) The Ultimate Guide To____ (“The Ultimate Guide to Going Low Carb”)

(“The Ultimate Guide to Going Low Carb”) [Number] Lessons I Learned From____ (“5 Lessons I Learned from Waking up at 5am for 30 Days”)

(“5 Lessons I Learned from Waking up at 5am for 30 Days”) [Number] Strategies That Will Help You ____ (“7 Strategies That Will Help You Improve Your Writing Skills”)

Once you’ve written the final version of your headline, evaluate it and ask yourself, “Is this headline clear and easy to understand? And does it make me eager to read the article right this minute?”

You can also run your headlines through the Coschedule Headline Analyzer to see if there are ways to tweak them to make them more powerful.

The Takeaway

In his book How to Write a Good Advertisement, copywriter Victor A. Schwab writes,

“The headline is like a flag being held up by a flagman alongside a railroad track. He is using it to try to get the immediate attention of the engineer of an approaching train so that he can give him some kind of message…The message on the flag…must be persuasive enough…to compete with all the other distractions of life. It must capture attention. And it must offer a ‘reward for reading’.”

If you follow the five-step process in this article, your headline will act just like a bright red flag waving down your readers so you can share your important message with them.",https://medium.com/copywriting-secrets/a-powerful-five-step-process-for-writing-captivating-headlines-50f939d6166a,Nicole Bianchi,2020-02-08 17:08:51.054000+00:00,"Marketing,Writing,Productivity,Writing Tips,Creativity"
Loss Aversion — how fear influences customer choice,"Loss Aversion — how fear influences customer choice

Why the possibility of loss is one of the most potent psychological principles in marketing

Photo by Kristina Tripkovic on Unsplash

Have you ever experienced FOMO — the “Fear of Missing Out”?

It’s a form of social anxiety that makes people scared they’re being left out of exciting or interesting events. It’s usually triggered by posts on social media, where it looks like the whole world is having fun without you.

If you suffer from FOMO, you’re not alone. A recent study found that 70% of millennials experience the fear of missing out regularly.

There’s a profound psychological principle behind why people experience FOMO.

It’s called Loss Aversion, and it can be a powerful design mechanism for guiding customer choice.

Photo by Noah Silliman on Unsplash

What is Loss Aversion?

First identified by Nobel Prize-winner Daniel Kahneman, Loss Aversion is a psychological principle that says people will go to great lengths to avoid losing.

In fact, the psychological pain of losing is twice as powerful as the pleasure of winning.

Because it’s so powerful, Loss Aversion features heavily in cognitive psychology and decision theory. It’s also one of the most effective tactics for getting customers to buy (the other being Social Proof).

A customer’s hatred of losing can take lots of forms, each with fascinating applications.

How information is presented can dramatically impact what decisions people make

“Losses loom larger than gains.” — Daniel Kahneman

Photo by JC Gellidon on Unsplash

For example, a study was conducted to see if framing cancer treatments using Loss Aversion could improve surgery opt-in rates.

The research team hypothesized that opt-in rates were related to how the options were framed.

To test this hypothesis, doctors presented patients with two options. Each framed surgery as a potential gain or a possible loss — the results were staggering.

Surgery framed as a gain: “The one-month survival rate of surgery is 90%.” Surgery framed as a loss: “There is a 10% chance of death in the month post-surgery.”

When framed as a gain, 84% of people chose surgery. But when framed as a loss, only 50% opted in.

This simple application of Loss Aversion increased surgery opt-ins by 54%.

Ownership creates emotional bonds that people don’t want to break

This principle is known as the Endowment Effect. It’s a psychological principle that falls under the Loss Aversion umbrella.

In “Predictably Irrational,” Dan Ariely describes this effect through the lens of Duke University basketball.

Photo by JC Gellidon on Unsplash

If you’re unfamiliar with Duke basketball, all you need to know is the Duke-UNC game is the biggest of the year. And that it takes place in an area of the country where basketball is a religion.

To score tickets to this game, students have to camp out for weeks. They then enter a lottery for a chance to win tickets.

Ariely reached out to students who won tickets and those who entered the lottery but didn’t win. Both had invested the same amount of pain, sacrifice, time, and effort to enter the lottery. But some had won, and others hadn’t.

Would this affect how each group valued the basketball tickets?

The results were interesting. Students who were not successful in the lottery said they’d pay an average of $170 for a ticket.

But the students who did get a ticket? When asked how much they’d sell their ticket for, they asked 170% more for their ticket — about $2,400 on average.

The question is — why were the owners asking so much for their tickets?

The answer? Emotion.

According to Ariely, once someone owns a product, they begin fantasizing about their future experiences. Once they create these “pre-memories” of the game, ticket-holders don’t want to lose out.

So these students wouldn’t only be selling a ticket. They’d be losing out on potential memories, emotions, and good times.

The lesson — the more emotions associated with a product, the more people value it.",https://medium.com/choice-hacking/loss-aversion-how-fear-influences-customer-choice-605bbb13feb5,Jennifer Clinehens,2020-11-25 15:46:38.580000+00:00,"Marketing,Business,Creativity,Psychology,Startup"
The FDA Banned These Chemicals — and They’re Still Everywhere,"The FDA Banned These Chemicals — and They’re Still Everywhere

Antibacterial compounds are no longer in your hand soap, but they’re in your floors, your walls, and in your body.

Just about two years ago, activists who work to reduce environmental contamination from hazardous chemicals were feeling pretty cheerful. After a struggle that had lasted decades, they’d persuaded the Food and Drug Administration to ban a slate of antibacterial chemicals from soaps and bodywashes in the United States.

The rap on the chemicals — especially the best-known and most common ones on the list, triclosan and triclocarban — was that hundreds of pieces of scientific research revealed they did more harm than good to humans and to the environment. Mouse studies suggested that these bacteria-killing compounds might affect hormone production and damage the microbiome, and they appeared to contribute to antibiotic resistance. Moreover, cleansers with these chemicals were no better at killing infectious bugs than plain soap and water.

The ban on triclosan and triclocarban was an achievement, given that the FDA had been mulling it over since 1974. But it was only a partial victory. Triclosan and triclocarban are still dosed into the carpets we walk on, added to the household plastics we handle every day, and blended into the caulk in our bathrooms and the paint on our walls. They are routine ingredients in fabrics and plastics — and thus in floor wax, air-conditioning coils, kitchen tools, and kids’ toys. Like a phone call in an old horror movie, triclosan and triclocarban are coming from inside the house.

Unlike hand sanitizers and soaps, all these products fall under the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), rather than the FDA. And the EPA has so far shown no signs of cracking down on their use.

“There are thousands of products outside of the FDA’s regulatory reach that pose similar exposure and health threats,” says Rolf Halden, director of the Biodesign Center for Environmental Health Engineering at Arizona State University, who began researching triclosan in 2002. He estimates that more than 2,000 common products sold in the United States still contain the compounds.

Like a phone call in an old horror movie, triclosan and triclocarban are coming from inside the house.

Why dose your walls and carpets with antibacterials? To protect the objects themselves from attack by bacteria and mold, says Mae Wu, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which helped bring about the FDA ban by filing a lawsuit against the agency in 2010. “It’s impregnated in all these products as a preservative.”

It might seem like a good thing to have walls that don’t harbor bacteria and spatulas that gunk won’t grow on. The problem, Wu said, is that the antibacterials don’t stay bound up in the materials they have been added to. As those household products wear and decay, the compounds escape and find other things in your house to cling to. “It ends up in household dust,” she says. “It’s coming off your bathroom caulk, or off the mousepad you just bought.”

It’s … everywhere

Last year, Halden and more than 200 other scientists detailed the ongoing threats related to these disinfectants in a scientific paper that has come to be known as the Florence Statement, for the location of the conference where it was drafted. The statement cites almost 170 pieces of research in order to document the persistent hazards of triclosan and triclocarban. The compounds flow into wastewater, pile up in sewage (and contaminate crop fields when sewage sludge is used as fertilizer), persist in the soil, accumulate in aquatic plants, and collect in the flesh of fish and livestock.

What’s more, a range of studies in the United States and in other countries have found traces of the chemical in human blood, urine, and breast milk. Over several decades, experiments in animals and observations in people show that in addition to interfering with hormone production, triclosan and triclocarban disrupt the endocrine system, damage heart muscle, affect the growth of fetuses, and may increase allergic reactions in children.

The compounds flow into wastewater, pile up in sewage, persist in the soil, accumulate in aquatic plants, and collect in the flesh of fish and livestock.

They may also contribute to one of the world’s most pressing health threats. Microbiologists have long suspected that triclosan’s ability to kill bacteria might create the same risks as the overuse of antibiotics. That is, a low or diluted dose might kill only the vulnerable bacteria, permitting bacteria that have developed defenses against the compounds to flourish and dominate. When that happens with antibiotics, the drugs became less and less useful as resistant bacteria take over. Antibiotic resistance kills an estimated 23,000 Americans and 700,000 people around the world each year.

In 2016, Halden and researchers from Harvard and the University of Oregon demonstrated that these disinfectants could make the problem of antibiotic resistance worse. They took samples of dust from indoor public spaces at their universities and subjected them to tests to reveal both the genetic and the chemical contents of the dust. The more triclosan there was in the dust, they found, the more antibiotic resistance bacterial genes the dust also contained. It suggests the disinfectant was influencing which bacteria survived and died. The alarming possibility: Triclosan may be changing the environmental microbiome and enriching it with bacteria that are potentially dangerous to human health.

Other recent work demonstrates how these compounds may be affecting animal microbiomes, setting up the possibility that they could do the same to us. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts fed triclosan to mice, so that they developed a blood concentration equal to what many humans already carry. Those antibacterial loads devastated the mice’s gut microbiomes, the mix of bacteria that help digest food, synthesize vitamins, and communicate to the immune system. The team reported in June that the mice that were fed triclosan experienced inflammation that could predispose them to other gut problems. In mice that had been engineered to have the equivalent of inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer — conditions that many humans have — triclosan made those illnesses worse, with more cellular damage and larger tumors.

This precise effect had never been shown before. “We think our study suggests triclosan has previously unknown health risks,” says Guodong Zhang, the paper’s senior author and an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

To remove disinfectants, apply consumer pressure

Despite these emerging risks, it’s not at all clear that regulation of triclosan and triclocarban will change in the near term. The EPA last evaluated the chemicals in 2008. The agency usually reviews chemicals on a 15-year cycle but began another review of triclosan early, in 2013.

Since then, of course, the government has changed hands, and so has leadership of the agency. Trump’s pick for EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, resigned in July after several ethics controversies, and the agency is currently headed by an acting administrator, a situation in which the EPA is unlikely to take any big steps. A spokesperson told NEO.LIFE that the agency expects to complete its review next year.

Some manufacturers are quietly changing their products’ formulas to phase out the problem chemicals without advertising they have done so.

With further policy changes unlikely, advocates hope the market will speak instead. Arlene Blum, the executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute in Berkeley — which won a multi-year battle to get toxic flame retardants removed from fabrics — thinks the way to reduce disinfectant use lies in targeting big purchasers such as car manufacturers, home builders, and huge retail chains.

“It’s really hard for the government — EPA, the FDA — to move quickly, but manufacturers and retailers can,” she says. “It’s not hard to motivate big buyers and trade associations when money is on the line.”

There is a precedent: Over the past four years, most poultry producers in the United States stopped routinely feeding antibiotics to their birds, largely because of consumer pressure from individuals and from big institutional buyers such as school systems and medical centers.

And there are subtle signs of change. The advocacy group Beyond Pesticides maintains a list of consumer products that contain triclosan and triclocarban. In some cases, the group says, manufacturers are quietly changing their products’ formulas to phase out the problem chemicals without advertising they have done so. Other manufacturers are explicitly embracing triclosan-free products: Halden is working with the Healthy Building Network, a research nonprofit that advocates for green and sustainable construction, to guide architects and materials manufacturers toward choosing components without these compounds.

If manufacturers stop adding triclosan and triclocarban to their products, the compounds in the environment now will slowly break down and disappear. As long as these chemicals aren’t replaced with some equally risky compound, the damage done by these antibacterials could finally become a thing of the past.",https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-fda-banned-these-chemicals-and-theyre-still-everywhere-8b9a05b9fb46,Maryn Mckenna,2020-07-13 21:51:08.655000+00:00,"Health,Environment,Wellness,Microbiome,Science"
Can This Toxic Question Please Just Go Away?,"There’s a debate that anyone who has spent any amount of time thinking about being a writer has come across. (I’m going to go out on a ledge an say anyone who has thought about being any sort of artist has come up against this debate.)

Should we write because we must or should we write for money?

The must side is so earnest. Writers who insist that they write because they have no choice. It’s write or perish. And having readers is incidental. Money actually diminishes their must-ness.

The write for money side can be cold. They never write for free. They only write to their market. They hustle out work with shocking speed. They have the bottom line in mind at all times and being paid what they’re worth is the most important thing.

It’s enough to make me scream.

Look. You don’t have to choose.

You can be an earnest writer who feels honestly moved to be a storyteller — and still want to be paid for your work.

And you can want to earn money and still fully believe that you must write or die.

I’ve been writing pretty much every day since the sixth grade. I’m 47, so we’re talking about a habit stretching back more than thirty-five years.

I went to battle with my high school so that they’d let me take a creative writing class my senior year instead of AP world literature. My undergraduate work was in creative writing and I have a MFA.

The only thing I’ve ever wanted to be when I grow up is a writer.

Would I write, even if I wasn’t being paid?

Yeah. I would.

In fact, I have. I sure wrote a lot before I was ever paid for it. And I paid a lot for the privilege of learning how to do it better.

But guess what? I like being paid for my work. And I’m so sick of the insinuation that there’s something wrong with learning how to treat writing like what it is: a business.

It isn’t leveled at me very often —or at least, not that I notice. I’ll admit to being not super sensitive to the accusation when it’s thrown my way. It doesn’t matter to me any more than if someone screamed hey, you’re really tall at me or omg, your hair is so brown.

Okay. So I am. So it is. And yeah, I’m a professional writer who gets paid for her work. Readers matter to me. I get excited about them. So, the accusation, when it does come, rolls off.

But I see so many newer, less experienced writers gutted by the idea that if they aspire to a career as a writer they’re some how not real writers.

So, in case you need it . . .

You have permission to get excited about the business side of writing.

You have permission to celebrate earning a pay check for your writing. (Here’s a hint for you — almost all of the time, the must-ers aren’t getting a pay check. The must argument makes them feel better about themselves. And whatever, okay. But you don’t have to let it bring you down.)

You have permission to build an email list and learn about running a small business and conduct yourself like a professional.

Will I feel sorry for you if you professionalize writing to the point that there’s no room left for art or generosity? I really will.

Will you look like a tool if you take a public stance against ever writing something you’re not paid for? Yep.

But those are your choices.

And on the flip side . . .

You have permission to write for free. You even have permission to never once, in your whole life, give a thought to being paid for your work.

You have permission to write something just because it feels good, without any thought at all toward how you’ll monetize it.

You have permission to treat your writing like art and never think about it as a business.

Will I feel sorry for you if you’re never able to let yourself turn your art into your career? I will, if you’re miserable in your actual career and I think you could be a professional writer, sure.

Will you look like a tool if you get up on your high horse about not caring about being paid for writing? Oh, yes.

But, those are your choices.

What you don’t have permission to do is tear someone else down.

You do you. Try to give other people the space and grace to do them.

Even if what they do isn’t the way you do things.",https://medium.com/the-write-brain/can-you-write-for-love-and-for-money-665fbd8ae6a9,Shaunta Grimes,2019-07-25 14:50:21.352000+00:00,"Creativity,Art,Entrepreneurship,Productivity,Writing"
This is sloppy and hides intent if you ever reference it more,"These similarities below are the skills and tools that both roles use. Mainly used by both are the programming languages and tools that help to deploy a Data Science model. Depending on the company, a Data Scientist could expect to work more on deployment, or the same could be said about a Data Engineer.

Most importantly in Data Science, is the ability to communicate. You will most likely have to work with a Product Manager or stakeholder to go over weaknesses in the business before you even look at the data in your company and start your Data Science model building process.

This is also the case in higher education, where even choosing a college has become a matter of life and death. We have moved from a time when colleges were a community’s lifeblood — providing jobs, culture, and diversity of thought and experience — to a time when many college campuses have become Covid hotspots, bringing rising infection rates and fear to the communities they once enriched.

Now if you need to reference the name later, you will be doing so via a named variable vs. an index value. This works well for response data that you’ll likely know the structure of. As long as the person’s information is always in the same order, you can destructure and assign everything over and over again to avoid using index values.

Using the ** operator on the dict as you’re passing a dict to the function allows you to unpack all of the arguments successfully (instead of accidentally passing the dict object itself). Although this method does add another variable and a separate data structure, it improves overall readability when there are a larger number of arguments. Moving the function call around or referencing multiple calls to the same function with the same (or slightly tweaked) arguments now becomes infinitely easier and requires less overall modification.

If you pass a class to dir, it will list all of the attributes for that object. This includes the names of its functions. By filtering for a prefix, suffix, or included keyword in the string name, we can group the functions of this class into different categories. This allows us to “pick up” new functions whose names include a keyword and either call them all or perform other logic with them later on in the code.

Although certain formats of this indentation style might technically be allowed in PEP8, I personally do not enjoy looking at heavily indented function arguments. You are forced to move your eyes all the way over to the right, some IDEs don’t play nice with this indentation, and using this style inhibits future extensibility.

If you’re using an API that requires an API key, please keep that key a secret. If you’re not planning on uploading your code or hosting your project publicly, you should be fine, but if you are going to upload it to GitHub or host it live then take these steps to keep your API key secret.

We have moved from a time when colleges were a community’s lifeblood — providing jobs, culture, and diversity of thought and experience — to a time when many college campuses have become Covid hotspots, bringing rising infection rates and fear to the communities they once enriched.

There are lessons to be learned for organizations, leaders, and individuals. For Champlain College, all that we learned from the pandemic this fall helps to fuel our optimism about the future. The following lessons are ones we will take forward in defining what 2021 looks like on our campus:

Then when you want to use this environment variable in your code, refer to it using process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY instead of a string containing your API key. Don’t forget to also add your .env file to your .gitignore.As covered earlier, APIs are a great tool to understand and implement. This article has set out to provide an overview of what APIs are, examples of popular APIs, and a brief tutorial on how to make requests. I hope that this article has been helpful, thanks for reading!https://medium.com/dataseries/hiding-secret-info-in-python-using-environment-variables-a2bab182eea — This is a great tutorial blog post on using environment variables in Python.

The coronavirus pandemic has transformed us from a nation that shunned discussions of death to one that receives daily mortality reports. In the face of unimaginable loss — of friends, family, jobs, and freedom — many have adopted a “hospice mentality,” a state of mind where our best days are behind us and the future is bleak.

In your project folder, create a file called .env (a file where we can store environment variables). In this file on the first line, you’re going to want to type REACT_APP_API_KEY= and then paste your API key. No quotes, no ;

Using the ** operator on the dict as you’re passing a dict to the function allows you to unpack all of the arguments successfully (instead of accidentally passing the dict object itself). Although this method does add another variable and a separate data structure, it improves overall readability when there are a larger number of arguments. Moving the function call around or referencing multiple calls to the same function with the same (or slightly tweaked) arguments now becomes infinitely easier and requires less overall modification.

For skills, these are used to query data, clean data, apply transformations, prepare data for Machine Learning algorithms, and visualize both exploratory data analysis and results of the Data Science model. Data Scientists often use platforms like Jupyter Notebook as well (or other similar ones) to perform research, including both code and comments, with a nice way to visualize and organize their work in progress.

When I started my presidency at Champlain College in Burlington, VT on July 1, our students had been sent home and the pandemic ravaged the country. Leading a college through a pandemic during a time of economic upheaval, social unrest, racial injustice, a divisive political landscape, and a climate crisis, has been the greatest test of my professional career. Yet I believe the true test of a leader is finding ways to pivot in an uncertain world and meet challenges with innovation and creativity.

Even as we approach a year of the pandemic with no end in sight, I feel optimistic about the future. And, I am not alone. A survey commissioned by Champlain College Online about career prospects, Covid-19, and the election found 66% of responders felt positive about the future. That positivity also translated into action, with two out of three respondents taking steps to improve their career prospects.

What are some of the key skills and concepts that define the role of a Data Scientist? There is plenty to discuss, so I will include some of these that I have personally worked with or have seen across several job descriptions. A Data Scientist can be defined in different ways, with differing opinions, but to me, I believe a Data Scientist is a person who employs the use of data and Machine Learning algorithms, to solve business problems efficiently. Therefore, with this definition, I will speak to the respective skills that tie in.Before we start, let’s acknowledge that these roles vary from company to company. That being said, there are still general themes to each specific role of Data Scientist and Data Engineer that differentiate them. Simply put, the skills and tools of each role can see plenty of overlap, but the concepts and goals differ greatly. I will be discussing in more detail the skills, concepts, similarities, and differences between the two positions. Please read below for a discussion on Data Science and Data Engineering; what makes them similar, and what makes them different.These concepts below are ones to keep in mind as Data Science is not just code and programming, but a role that helps to solve business problems. Efficiency and saving money go hand-in-hand, and they are especially prevalent for Data Scientists. These are useful for any role, but for Data Science, the goal is to automate a process from the benefit of a Machine Learning algorithm. In turn, this model will save money and time. You will need to know how the specific algorithms work so that you can also optimize for the best algorithm. Statistics is important to know, especially when you are A/B testing and setting up experiments for a product.

In this example, let’s assume we have the class above containing a large number of functions. Some of these functions serve a special purpose and should be dynamically accessible. We want any special function that we add to this class to be immediately picked up by the rest of our code so that it begins working right away. One way to accomplish this is simply by using dir on the containing class.",https://jafarhaxor.medium.com/this-is-sloppy-and-hides-intent-if-you-ever-reference-it-more-9998f80b85be,Jafar Arif,2020-12-10 16:25:46.023000+00:00,"Humor,Mental Health,Health,Coronavirus,Science"
"Don’t Be a Writer, Be an Entrepreneur Who Writes","Don’t Be a Writer, Be an Entrepreneur Who Writes

The world isn’t short of great writers, it’s short of great entrepreneurs who write

Photo by Austin Distel on Unsplash

An entrepreneur who writes is different from a writer. Being an entrepreneur means your true passion lies in using your wits to make money. Writing is your weapon of choice. A writer’s passion, by contrast, lies in the craft itself.

A quick multiple choice question can reveal which one you are.

Is making money from your writing more important than being a great writer?

a) Yes, definitely.

b) No, being a great writer is more important.

c) I’d like to have both equally.

Got your answer?

Here’s the twist. It doesn’t matter what you choose. Writing and blogging is so competitive you have little choice but to adapt and evolve into an entrepreneur. If writing is more important, treat the entrepreneurial side of things as a necessary evil that helps facilitate your passion.

Plan like an entrepreneur

An entrepreneur views writing as a means to an end. Not the end itself. Being an awesome writer helps, but it’s not the most important aspect of a writing based business/side-hustle.

As with any startup, writing a blog post requires an investment in planning and research. A single blog post requires a business plan. Yup, you read that correctly.

A reminiscent post about how your sibling used to blow their nose and wipe it on you (that’s just a hypothetical example) doesn’t need a business plan. I’m talking specifically about money posts intended to carve out your own slice of the pie, make money, or contribute to the foundation of your writing empire.

Here’s a quick overview of what a blog post business plan contains.

Blog post business plan from How to make money blogging on SME Pals.

Like any entrepreneur starting a business you need to know:

How much time and effort is required.

What financial costs there are.

What gaps or angles exist.

What obstacles exist.

Who the competition is and what they’re doing right (and wrong).

How much traffic there is.

Who your audience is.

How much money you can make (depending on the type of affiliate relationship, product or service you’re offering).

How to make that money.

How long it will take to start making money.

…

For me, the most valuable part of putting together a business plan is the market research — more specifically, competitor analysis. Competitor analysis is wildly useful for bloggers. It illuminates the tactics successful competitors use to win market share and earn revenue. If you want to be the best, learn from the best.

Most of all, and I can’t stress how important this is,

A blog post business plan will tell you whether or not your idea is viable and worth pursuing.

Don’t waste time on content you have already shown to have insufficient earning potential. Find something else. Explore new topics. Move on.

Write like an entrepreneur

Here’s where writers and entrepreneurs who are writers join hands. At this stage, the better you are at engaging and captivating an audience, the better you’ll do.

Here are some handy tips I’ve found to work well for money-content.

Win the title

Titles are hard!

You have to juggle three things at once in a single, short sentence:

Use target SEO keywords Accurately describe the content Spark intrigue

Take time over the title. It is absolutely critical to the success of your post.

A title is to a blog post what an elevator pitch is to a startup.

Wired wrote an article about what a difference clickable headlines make.

The difference between a good headline and a bad headline can be just massive. It’s not (in the ballpark of) a rounding error. When we test headlines we see 20% difference, 50% difference, 500% difference. A really excellent headline can make something go viral.

Adapt and fine-tune the title as you go. Hold off until it’s ready to go out there and captivate people. The title is often the last thing I work on — once I fully understand the content and purpose of the article itself.

Draw ’em in description

Make the description a promise of something greatly valuable for the reader.

A blog description must inspire readers with an exciting promise of value.

Along with the header, the description is about the only chance you have to convince visitors to click thru. Don’t waste it on a dry, boring description.

To do this properly you need to understand who’s going to be reading the article and what they need to know.

The description isn’t about the content; it’s about the reader.

Gripping section titles

Gripping. Is. Key.

Make sub-titles and headers gripping. Never, ever let go of the reader’s attention. Not for a second. Like the description, sub-headers should inspire and intrigue, pulling readers along. Gary Korisko gives us this great quote.

The four main ingredients of great sub-headers are curiosity, surprise, personality & emotion.

Pitch perfect

This is one aspect of writing I struggle with the most. Often, writing about topics in which I have a lot of experience causes me to lose the audience quickly. Avoid assuming too much or too little knowledge. Both are equally adept at turning readers off.

The better you understand your audience, the easier it is to pitch content in a way that keeps them captivated.

Captivate ‘em

Always maintain your energy and enthusiasm while writing. Take regular breaks to keep your mind fresh. Write when inspiration strikes.

Find a method that works for you and do everything in your power to avoid slipping into a mediocre, run-of-the-mill voice that allows readers to drift away (without a conversion).

Format for skimmers

Formatting plays a big role. Spacing, structure, fonts & layout all make a big difference in how easily readers digest and retain information.

Above all else. Be concise & clear. According to Hubspot,

73% of visitors skim rather than read the blog post thoroughly.

Formatting is a way to break up content in a way that entices readers to keep going. Especially people who are starting out with a cursory scan of the article to see if it’s worth their time.

Cite experienced influencers & experts

Don’t look at blogging as something you do alone.

Blogging is a collaborative effort and diverse perspectives add value.

Gathering input from influencers in your niche is incredibly important for a bunch of reasons.

Experts know stuff (you don’t)

Relationships you build with influencers are valuable

Influencers can increase your reach and buzz

Influencers help you build trust & authority with your audience

Out of all these points, really the most salient and immediately valuable one is that including quotes and inputs from great influencers helps turn them into evangelists for your article — when it comes time to publish like an entrepreneur.

Influencers who have contributed to your article are more likely to mention or promote it.

Publish like an entrepreneur

Planning and creating content, together, should only constitute around one-third of your total investment in a piece of content— both in terms of time and money. That’s more or less how things tend to pan out for me. Maybe more, maybe less depending on your unique topic, network and reach.

Planning and creating content, together, should only constitute around one-third of your total investment in a piece of content.

I tend to publish money-pieces to my own blog because I want it to generate income for some time to come. Publishing a piece like this on 3rd party platforms arguably provides greater initial reach and a higher chance of ranking in Google search. It also comes with some potentially serious downsides.

Many big publisher will happily take your content and publish at an off-time where it quickly disappears from the front page without so much as a ripple. If that happens, it’s all for nothing. At least if it’s on your own site, you can continue to promote it and write guest articles citing any useful stats, facts and figures to keep a stream of traffic trickling along.

Whatever you choose, it’s time to start marketing. As I like to say,

It doesn’t matter what business you are in; the business you are in is marketing.

To wit, the folks at GrowthBadger had this to say about marketing and promoting your blog.

70% of bloggers who earn over $50,000 per year say they are active or very active promoters of their blogs, compared to only 14% of lower-income bloggers.

Make the news

Part of the business plan, back when you first started conceptualizing the article, would identify and integrate news media opportunities in some form or another. There should be at least one (preferably more) hook. Either:

Include newsworthy content (original research, current trends, novelty, conflict, etc) in the post Create news that cites your blog post

Interest stories are a great way to go — especially if it cites your new article in some way or another.

Create a newsworthy story by talking about other people, organizations or businesses doing incredible things.

Include local content if local media coverage is important. Interview people. Do Research. Offer a prize. Offer a scholarship. Do whatever it takes to be able to pitch something unique and interesting to reporters and journalists covering your beat.

Just. Be. Newsworthy.

I wrote an article highlighting the best new business ideas coming out of U.S. universities. That’s newsworthy because it a showcases up and coming entrepreneurial talent bubbling away at American colleges. Also, it has nothing to do with me.

Pitching a great story to the right media often results in a bit of coverage that can go a long way.

10 best new business ideas from university entrepreneurs posted to USA Today.

Getting into the news requires a slightly different set of writing skills. Namely, press releases. At some point you’ll need to learn how to hook journalists using attention-grabbing headlines and give them everything they need to make their news article easy and compelling for their readers.

You can check out a press releases templates, including a few practical tips here.

Influence the influencers

Having worked hard to collaborate with a whole bunch of experts and influencers, it’s now time to put those newfound contacts to good use (apart from the, hopefully, great quotes and info they contributed to your piece).

Put together a personalized pitch for each person you mentioned or collaborated with. Here’s a quick template that should do the trick for someone you only mentioned (but don’t necessarily know personally):

Subject: Congrats! You’ve been mentioned in my latest article.

Hi [name],

I really learned a lot from your piece about [title] and mentioned it (with a link) under [sub-topic] in my latest article [title][link].

I’d love it if you would consider contributing an additional insight for this article?

It can be as long or short as you like. I will of course cite and link your contribution. If you can also share a link to a head-shot that would be great.

Thanks,

David

The purpose of this outreach is primarily to thank them for being awesome enough to include in your post. Next, you want to tell them you’ve already given them great coverage (without asking for anything first). Finally there’s an offer to contribute more — requiring them to at least take the time to look at your article.

This is significantly more effective than any of the hundreds of emails I get on an ongoing basis asking me for coverage in one of my posts. Instead of asking for something, reach out to share what you’ve already done for them (not a promise to do something, if only they…).

Influence any influencer with an easy 3-step process. Offer. Engage. Pitch.

Alternatively, if they collaborated with you, the outreach email might look more like this:

Subject: I’ve added your awesome insights!

Hi [name],

I added and linked your contribution. Thanks so much. I’m super happy with it.

Check it out at [title][link].

I’ve also followed you on [social network] and [2nd/3rd/etc social network] to keep up to date with what you’re working on. Feel free to drop me a line if I can help out or contribute in any way.

If you love the article please consider linking or mentioning it.

Thanks,

David

In this instance you are thanking them for being awesome. Letting them know that you’ve become a fan and are following them. Offering to work with them and collaborate on future projects. Requesting a link or a mention if they really like the article (their name is on it already so it’s far more likely they will at least share it around).

Cast a wide net

Initially, if the article is self-published, it’s likely not going to drive much traffic — unless you have a huge audience and/or a good relationship with Google’s first page rankings.

Spend some time exploring related content. It could be drilling down into more depth, new research, finding opposing views, or whatever. Get new content up and about that links back to your article from other blogs and sites.

Draw on your newfound experience and knowledge to write and pitch fantastic guest articles to related blogs, websites & media.

Don’t stop

An article is never really finished. There will always be new opportunities for marketing and promotions to explore. Opportunities to add and update the article with great new content. Opportunities to unearth new opportunities.

It’s up to the entrepreneur in you to find clever new gaps to exploit, build new partnerships to generate more revenue, or simply decide to move on to the next exciting article. Sometimes it’s nice to sit back and watch earnings build up passively over time.

Like this

Passive earnings from a single blog post.

Decide to promote via social media. Or don’t. Try paid advertising. Or don’t. Learn new tricks from people who are dominating. Or blaze your own trail. The sky really is the limit when it comes to the business of content. That’s what interests me the most.

Sometimes you’ll get lucky and an article will out-earn your expectations handsomely. It happens now and then. Dumb luck definitely plays a role. Make sure you’re in the game long enough by being smart about everything you publish. In the long run, it’s way more profitable to make your own luck.",https://medium.com/swlh/dont-be-a-writer-be-an-entrepreneur-who-writes-61ff86af4f0b,David Mercer,2020-08-28 15:29:50.267000+00:00,"Entrepreneurship,Writing,Startup,Marketing,Blogging"
What Should Systems Neuroscience Do Next? Voltage Imaging,"What Should Systems Neuroscience Do Next? Voltage Imaging

The best thing about being a neuroscientist is that neuroscience never stands still. Barely a week passes without some new major result, a sparkling technological breakthrough, a provoking theoretical idea. And the sheer complexity of brains means the questions available are practically infinite. So even if your specific corners of brain research have briefly slowed their breathless pace, there is always more to learn. Always new questions to tackle. Indeed, there are whole regions of the mammalian brain whose mysteries have barely been probed, and which will no doubt turn out to be crucial for our understanding. My money’s on the zona incerta, the globus pallidus, and the septum. Exciting times.

The worst thing about being a neuroscientist is that neuroscience never stands still. Barely a week passes without some new result, breakthrough, or theory that you don’t have time to read; that ends up filed for later, destined never to be opened; or to be skimmed and not assimilated. And the sheer complexity of brains means the questions available are practically infinite. So even if you’re lucky enough that your specific corners of brain research have briefly slowed their breathless pace, there is always more to learn. Always new questions to tackle. Indeed, there are whole regions of the mammalian brain whose mysteries have barely been probed, and which will no doubt turn out to be crucial for our understanding. Worrying times.

Paradoxically, this best and worst of all possible worlds in mind research is created by mindless churn. Of doing whatever can or could be done next. Not what should be done next. So, hubristically, I thought I’d plant my feet against the torrent and take a stab at separating the should from the could. A series of occasional pieces that set out to answer the question: what should systems neuroscience do next?

In this first piece, we start with the very definition of systems neuroscience. It is at heart the study of the activity of multiple individual neurons, of the messages they are sending. Everything we see, do, or think in the moment is through neurons sending spikes to each other. So a clear priority for systems neuroscience is to make the best recordings of the output of the most neurons, and with as much metadata about those neurons — where they are, how many there are, what type they are — as possible.

We have two mainstream ways of recording the output of individual neurons: insert electrodes to record spikes, or image calcium fluxes in the neurons’ bodies as a proxy for spikes. Both have unique strengths, both are constantly evolving in the white-heat of technology (and cash), but both have problems that are solved by the other. So our first “should”: we should find a recording method that combines the strengths of both. The great news is that we already know the answer. The answer is voltage imaging.

And if we get it solved, voltage imaging comes with a massive bonus prize, something neither electrodes nor calcium imaging can buy us: live connectomics.",https://medium.com/the-spike/what-should-systems-neuroscience-do-next-voltage-imaging-9bfa5d6a4df9,Mark Humphries,2019-12-30 20:32:09.324000+00:00,"Neuroscience,Psychology,Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning,Science"
Why Writing Online Is Different,"I published my first article in November 2014. I had no idea what I was doing, but I had fun. Ironically, the only way to keep this fun around long-term was to consider writing the most serious job I’ve ever had. So I committed.

Now, over four years later, nothing is the same. Except that part. The fun’s still here. I even have a slightly better idea of what I’m doing. But writing online is different from anything I’d ever imagined or associated with that word.

Here are 3 lessons I rarely see others mention, but that helped me get to now.

1. People aren’t waiting to change their perspective. You have to do it for them.

No none walks around saying: “I wish someone changed my mind about productivity.” That’s not how humans work. We’re intensely focused on our day, ourselves, our next task at hand, zipping through everyday life with tunnel vision. Browsing the web and reading online are no different.

If anything, we hope to bump into ideas that confirm our worldview, not challenge it. This onus lies entirely on you, the writer. People don’t just underestimate it but, often, abandon this challenge altogether, going the easier route of telling people what they know they’ll want to hear.

This works for a while, especially when you’re just beginning, but it gets old really quick. Readers don’t know they’re driven by these biases, but from feeding them, even subconsciously, they still get bored. And that’s a feeling they know. So they move on.

What they might not know they want — but need — is an idea that cracks their perspective. A tiny fracture, just big enough for them to raise their eyebrows. To blink twice. To scroll up again. Presenting this idea is what I try to do in most of my headlines. The article is just the fulfillment center.

The line between offending people and making them think is infinitely small. But learning to dance on it is one of the most important skills you’ll ever learn.

2. The only agenda that works is to have no agenda.

That sounds weird. Of course I have an agenda. Everyone does. I want dollars. Followers. Views. However, the single greatest way to maximize all of those in the long run is to not care when you’ll get them and in what order.

Because that’s the only way you’ll be free to overwhelm the platforms you write on with generosity, consistency, and genuine care. It’s not about you. Great work never is. The sooner you can act that out, the earlier you’ll take off.

What does the host want? What do readers want? What does the platform want for its readers and what do readers expect for giving their invaluable time and attention to this place? Notice how absent you are from all these important questions. I know it’s counterintuitive, but it’s also liberating.

No one cares about what you want, but then you also don’t have to care about your own mess-ups. You can just try again. Whatever you do, if you start from integrity and maintain it above all else, you’ll never be in a rush to get yours.

Because you’ll know it’s coming to you. Maybe not tomorrow and definitely not today. But it’s coming — and you’ll know what to do with it once it does.

3. Change before you need to or you’ll adapt too late.

If you were to browse through my entire history of articles, you’d think it’s a collection of writing from at least five different people. Everything changes, all the time. Style. Voice. Content. Vocabulary. Structure. Formatting.

Sometimes, it’s me reaching the next level. Sometimes, it’s me adopting a trend early. Most of the time, however, it’s me experimenting on purpose. Changing for the sake of change. To set trends, rather than wait for them.

At first sight, this is a stupid strategy. Why give up what’s working? Why mess with a winning team? It means I’m alienating my fans. Or forcing them to grow with me. I’ll lose the people who just got here and I might not win over those who are about to. But it also means I’m staying true to myself.

Who wants to be one-dimensional? Who actually is? No one. Consistency of character is a myth. Just like content that confirms our views, it’s attractive on the surface, but boring and inauthentic underneath.

If you embrace your contradictions and allow them to flow freely, you still won’t get every shift in context right each time, but you’ll learn to keep an open mind. It’ll be easier to write more game changers (see #1) and reduce friction when you have to adapt (see #2). Most of all, it’ll keep writing fun.

And isn’t that what we truly want?",https://ngoeke.medium.com/3-lessons-from-4-years-of-writing-eff24b1b6d78,Niklas Göke,2019-04-05 06:46:33.957000+00:00,"Marketing,Creativity,Art,Entrepreneurship,Writing"
Your Brand is What People Expect From You,"Your Brand is What People Expect From You

Here’s what you can do about it

Photo by Nadine Shaabana via Unsplash

When people first meet you, they don’t know what to expect.

So they start judging you by your name, your profile picture, and the title of your blog post.

If you’re a writer, people will probably meet your words before they meet you.

What are your words saying to them?

I’m a nice person.

I know what I’m talking about.

I have a B.S. in History.

Of course, you can’t just say those things and expect us to believe them or be impressed. It’s better for you to prove it and let us draw these conclusions ourselves.

When we read your words, we’re after something. Maybe we’re bored and we want you to give us a distraction. Maybe we want an edge and we need your advice to raise our status. Or maybe we are interested in what you’re talking about and you happen to share our worldview.

You won’t automatically have our trust because we agree with you. But it’s a nice start, and perhaps the best route to get trust quickly.

The best way to gain trust is to keep showing up.

I’ve learned this lesson the hard way. There have been times in my life when my freelance work sucked all my time away. When that happens, I feel like I can’t be as generous with my words.

When you disappear, people forget.

Who was that guy who was so good? Yeah. What happened to him?

Hey, have you heard about this new writer? He’s hot. He knows stuff I never dreamed anyone could know. It’s like he can read my mind.

It’s amazing how fast that can happen.

Show up. Every day if you can. At least once a week. Find a regular rhythm and stick with it. And if you really want to dig deep, write twice as much as you think you can.

But what if it isn’t perfect?

It never will be, so quit worrying.

Your best today won’t be your best next week, next month, or next year. It’s your responsibility to push yourself. Stretch a little every time you write. Dig a little deeper than you did last time. Write something that scares you a bit more. Take a stand, and don’t back down.

In a world with millions of voice vying for attention, it’s the bold and committed that stand out.

Be you, always.

You have some control over what we expect.

It’s your choice to deliver the same thing again and again. Or maybe you ruffle our feathers a bit each week. You’ve got more room to play around in the beginning. But as your audience grows and gets more familiar with you, you need to be consistent.

What will your message be?

How will you deliver it?

Will your personality be friendly or businesslike? Will you challenge our assumptions? Will you draw us a better map? Will you take something confusing and break it down so we can understand it?

Being you means you do online what you’d do in real life. Spot the trends if you like, but approach them with your own style. When you’re fake, everyone will know.

Don’t chase dollars. Chase change. How will you leave your reader better than you found her?

In time, your audience defines your brand.

You set the first impression.

Your audience sets the expectation.

Wait a minute, you say. You just said I set the expectation for people.

You do, at first.

Then once it’s set, people expect you to live up to it. Mess that up, and years of trust can be lost in a moment.

So tread carefully.

If you want to change your message because that’s your conviction, go for it. Don’t do it because the trends say you should. If you get in the habit of chasing the latest thing for attention, you might as well chase the wind.

Here’s the part of the market you should pay attention to.

What does your audience want from you? If your message meets a need a lot of people have, that’s probably not going to change overnight.

Take writing for example.

For generations, the way to make it as an author was through books. If you published one or more, you were somebody. But you had to compete for the opportunity. You’d probably get rejected most of the time. Because publishers need to make money, they bet on what they thought would sell.

Today, anyone can write and publish a book. So, the problem the previous generation of writers faced is flipped. It’s a lot harder to get noticed in the market when your book is one of millions of choices.

So, writers blog and make money instead. Books are now email magnets and manifestos. If you have a large following, you can command a higher price for your work. Otherwise, price low and be glad to get your message out so you can charge more later.

If you don’t like the expectation you’ve set for your market, work to raise it.

There’s nothing stopping you.

It will take work. You’ll lose some people along the way. But you’ll gain more who are devoted to the same thing you are. It doesn’t take a huge audience to make it. It just takes an audience that is pleased enough to tell other people about you.

Be authentic. Serve others first. Be generous. The more people you can, the better your future will be.

The Only Book About Writing You’ll Ever Need

I’ve read it 10 times

Six years ago, I sort of forgot how to write. I’d been publishing on the internet for a little over a year — that first, embarrassing, thrilling, bringing-a-laptop-to-parties year (I’m fun at parties) — and I’d run out of things to say. What used to be casual, fast, easy breezy bloggy beautiful, had become… slightly boring. Slow. I’d have an idea, stare at my laptop for an hour, Command-Tab over to Gmail, and then walk four blocks to buy an overpriced panini.

So, I did what I always do: I walked into a bookstore feeling vaguely depressed, and left with something to read.

I know you just want the name of the book, so here you go: Several Short Sentences About Writing by Verlyn Klinkenborg. It’s sort of a weird book, to be honest. It contains no paragraphs, just sentences stacked on top of each other in austere columns. (The whole thing sort of reads like a poem.) And yes, it’s about the mechanics of putting words together, but it’s also about other things: thinking, noticing, mapping the mess inside your head. Also, trusting yourself — something I have a difficult time doing.

There’s a lot of writing advice out there: books, articles, quotes from dead people. Most of it isn’t actually about writing. It’s about scheduling (wake up at six!), preparing to write (take good notes!), having ambition (write every day… at six…), or envisioning what it will feel like to finally be done writing. Most people don’t talk about the messy, often boring, sometimes excruciating and other times exhilarating process of staring at a computer and eating stale mixed nuts as you form thoughts into words.

In this book, you’ll find no tips for outlining, brainstorming, scheduling, or pitching. Nothing on a thesis statement, a topic sentence, an introduction, or conclusion (spoiler: good ideas need no introduction, or conclusion!) Nothing on rituals or waiting for fictional characters to whisper in your ear. No fantasies about having a cabin in the woods with a big dog and a chunky sweater and a blank Moleskine. In fact, there’s nothing in here about ~inspiration~ at all, nothing about waiting for the ideas to “just flow.” (They never just flow. Sorry.)

My whole life is just going to be me rereading this book. It’s sort of like I got really religious somewhere in my twenties, and this book is my Blogging Bible.

What you’ll find instead are practical, even curmudgeonly, tips about grammar, rhythm, and making individual sentences. Short ones, mostly. For example:

Keep sentences small. They’re easier to work with that way.

If something doesn’t feel right, there’s a problem with one or more of your sentences. Listen to that feeling. Try to pinpoint exactly which word or phrase is triggering it. Naming exactly what’s wrong, in grammatical terminology or otherwise, will come later.

Understanding a word’s etymology will teach you how to use it. Words contain imprints of their histories.

The subject of a sentence should appear as close to the beginning of a sentence as possible.

You don’t have to “grab” anyone with the first line of your story. Just write a simple sentence that says what you want it to say. It’s harder than it sounds! And also very effective, if done well.

“A writer’s real work is the endless winnowing of sentences, the relentless exploration of possibilities, the effort, over and over again, to see in what you started out to say the possibility of saying something you didn’t know you could.”

Noun phrases (“the realization that…”) almost always sound clunky and dead. Try rewriting them as verb phrases (“realizing that…”).

Prepositions are difficult to get right, even for native English speakers.

A reader’s experience has nothing to do with a writer’s. A sentence that reads “naturally” or “conversationally” to a reader may have been painstakingly assembled by a stressed-out writer who wishes they could sound more natural or conversational.

Toward the end of this book, the author diagnoses exactly what’s wrong with about 50 isolated sentences written by his students. It’s sort of ruthless, but fascinating. Most of these sentences sound almost okay, though you can feel something slightly amiss. Hearing Klinkenborg (what a name) pinpoint the specific problems in each one — from an awkward metaphor to a misplaced pronoun — is therapeutic. It’s sort of like Dr. Pimple Popper, but for dangling modifiers instead of giant cysts. I recommend reading the book just for this section.

Here’s a theory: Some people (i.e. me) procrastinate and never end up publishing anything because we’re fixated on the bigger Thing — the Novel, the Post, the Feature, the Investigative Whatever. We’re distracted by our intentions and our aspirations. But unless you’ve somehow acquired a ghostwriter, none of those bigger Things are possible until you make sentences. It’s tedious, but crucial. A wall is made of bricks. A story is made of sentences.

I still forget how to write sometimes, but whenever I do I know where to turn. This book calms me down. It reminds me that writing is slow and difficult because it’s a technology humans invented to communicate with each other thousands of years ago — not something we do “naturally.” We have to be taught to write. And we have to practice. (There’s an interesting part in the middle where Klinkenborg debunks our mistaken assumption that writing is “natural.” We think it should flow, easily and conversationally, thanks to a false analogy with talking. But talking and writing are very different, as anyone who’s tried to read a podcast transcript will tell you.)

Most of all, this book encourages me to listen to what I actually think before trying to shape those thoughts into words. It’s also taught me a lot about rhythm, beginnings, endings, nerdy things like participles, and clarity. These lessons don’t just apply to writing. They also apply to thinking and living.

I just finished reading it for, I think, the 10th time. (I know.) And right after I finished, I started back at page one. My whole life is just going to be me rereading this book. It’s sort of like I got really religious somewhere in my twenties, and this book is my Blogging Bible.

Brick by Brick: Build a multi-page dashboard,"CODE AND DOWNLOADS

The code for this series can be found at this Github repo. The application is run from Jupyter notebook. There are .py (Python) files that will contain code for the layout and data manipulation. I used, and highly recommend, Visual Studio Code for working with these as there are a number of handy extensions available for formatting that is particularly helpful to build the HTML DOM structure which we will accomplish with this article.

INSTALLATIONS

Follow along the instruction in this Medium article to set up and run the Dash app server from Jupyter notebook. The notebook in Github also lists the packages used as well as their versions to help you get going.

STRUCTURE

The Title bar declares the dashboard to be a Rental Analysis Dashboard. It will contain an icon to brand our dashboard. Beneath the title, on the left hand side, we create a navbar containing filters. For now these are generic dropdown lists containing three choices, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly. We will be using various types of filters as the project matures. The filter area is being defined in this scaffolding.

To the right of the filter pane is the chart area. I have split this up into four rows. The first row will be reserved for KPIs/gauges or cards with summary information to provide “at a glance” key aggregations.

We will follow that up with maps, line and bar chats to analyze the data from various angles. This will be the graphing area.

And finally at the bottom is the narrow band of page navigation links.

Folder structure and files

We will use Bootstrap to have a responsive dashboard page. To style the various HTML components and to use Bootstrap’s CSS, we create a folder called assets in the root of the app directory. We will also create a folder called data down the line that will contain all the data we gather in CSVs from the Inside AirBnB website. For Dash to recognize this folder structure, note that creation of the app includes __name__ in the constructor.

Important: Why you need to include __name__ in your Dash constructor.

There are other elements that we will store in the assets folder such as the icon and logo images. Once this folder structure is followed, retrieving the assets is performed with a call which depends on the image file being present in the assets folder.",https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/brick-by-brick-build-a-multi-page-dashboard-37912dd7d9e6,Simi Talkar,2020-12-16 17:28:39.014000+00:00,"Exploratory Data Analysis,Dashboard,Plotly,Visualization,Data Analysis"
Tech Execs Face Congress: 9 Big Takeaways,"Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg beamed into a congressional hearing via video chat today to face 4+ hours of questions about whether they abuse their dominant positions in the market. Spoiler: they said everything’s cool.

By Chloe Albanesius & Michael Kan

The CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook faced the House Judiciary Committee virtually today, where they fielded questions about whether their respective tech companies take advantage of their dominant positions in the market to enhance their bottom lines.

Spoiler: They all said they don’t.

As you’d expect, Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg offered rosy assessments of their platforms during opening statements. But the limited time each member of Congress got to ask questions didn’t allow for much additional explanation from the CEOs, many of whom are used to answering questions with winding speeches full of Silicon Valley platitudes.

Members on both sides of the aisle had bones to pick with the CEOs. The Democrats largely focused on the antitrust issues at hand: whether Amazon keeps its third-party sellers on a tight leash; if Google favors its own products in search; whether Facebook’s acquisitions served only to thwart competition; and if Apple’s fabled walled-garden approach persists.

Some Republicans did, too, but a few veered off course to quiz the execs on pet projects: Google allegedly discriminating against conservatives; Google pulling out of the Pentagon’s JEDI project; and why a certain member’s campaign emails keep ending up in his father’s spam folder.

The four-hour-plus hearing covered a lot of ground, and some topics were more interesting than others. Here are some of the highlights.

Facebook

Facebook-Instagram: Illegal Merger or a Savvy Dealmaking?

Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) accused Facebook of breaking antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram back in 2012 because it knew Instagram posed a potential threat to its hold over the social media market.

“In your own words you bought Instagram to neutralize the competitive threat. This was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction,” Nadler claimed, citing internal documents provided by Facebook. “Why should Instagram not be broken off into a separate company?”

Zuckerberg acknowledged he saw Instagram as a competitor, but only in the mobile-photo sharing space. The FTC also scrutinized and approved the acquisition in 2012. “I think with hindsight, it probably looks obvious that Instagram would’ve reached the scale it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,” he said, citing other top platforms of the time, like the now-defunct Path.

According to Zuckerberg, Instagram’s success is largely due to Facebook’s investment. “I think this has been an American success story,” he added.

Nadler disagreed. “Rather than compete with [Instagram], Facebook bought it. This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should have never happened in the first place,” he said.

Are You Threatening Me?

Nadler and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, (D-Washington), both brought up Zuckerberg’s negotiations with Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom ahead of the merger.

“In a chat you told Mr. Systrom that Facebook ‘was developing our own photo strategy, so how we engage now will also determine how much we are partners versus competitors down the line,’” Rep. Jayapal noted. “Instagram’s founder seemed to think that was a threat. He confided in an investor at the time that he feared you would go into ‘destroy mode’ if he didn’t sell Instagram to you.”

Zuckerberg denied it was a threat and characterized his email as a negotiating tactic. “I think it was clear this was a space where we were going to compete in, one way or another,” he said.

Preventing Imminent Risk of Life

Twitter was not present at today’s hearing, but its policies came up nonetheless. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, asked Zuckerberg why it had temporarily banned Donald Trump Jr. this week for sharing a COVID-19 conspiracy theory. Zuckerberg noted that it was Twitter, not Facebook, that took action against the president’s son. But Zuckerberg explained why the move was probably the correct one.

The video shared by Trump, Jr. featured a doctor who said that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19, which it does not. So while Facebook allows discussion around trials for drugs or personal experiences with experimental drugs, it does not allow people to definitively state that there is a cure for a disease when there isn’t one, Zuckerberg said.

“In general…we do not want to be the arbiters of truth,” Zuckerberg continued. But if “someone is going to go out and say that hydroxychloroquine is proven to clear COVID and that statement could lead people to take a drug … we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of life.”

Later in the hearing, Pichai agreed with that line of thinking when Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, asked why the video in question was also removed from YouTube.

“We believe in freedom of expression and there’s a lot of debate on effective ways to deal with COVID. But during a pandemic, we look to local health authorities [and] the CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation and [how it] might cause harm in the real world,” Pichai said.",https://medium.com/pcmag-access/tech-execs-face-congress-9-big-takeaways-5c6a06ecb921,,2020-07-30 12:05:09.891000+00:00,"Apple,Business,Google,Facebook,Amazon"
How to Be Productive and Creative in Times of Panic,"How to Be Productive and Creative in Times of Panic

It wouldn’t hurt to mute the word ‘coronavirus’ on social media for 24 hours

Credit: Westend61/Getty Images

Hours after the 9/11 attacks, I finally made it back to my apartment in uptown New York City. Like everyone else lucky enough to return home that day, I existed in a daze, not comprehending what had just happened and no longer sure how to function. I had no idea how to manage my anxiety in the weeks that followed, so I surrendered to the 24-hour news cycle and drank myself to sleep, hoping this would help me reclaim the world I had lost.

While the coronavirus pandemic is a very different world event, the hysteria feels oddly familiar to what we experienced in 2001. Back then, public spaces seemed like death traps; today they feel like contagion zones. We don’t know whether to trust the news. And there’s no end in sight.

I didn’t know how to deal with panic back in 2001, but I’ve learned some more productive approaches since then. Here are some tips for staying calm, productive, and even creative during the coronavirus outbreak.

Avoid the panic amplifiers

Much has been written about how social media intensifies our anxiety, and we never see this more clearly than during a crisis. Yesterday, I made the mistake of visiting my town’s Facebook page, and the first post I read was one that questioned whether school officials were doing enough to keep classrooms disinfected. A heated discussion followed, with people telling each other they were overreacting, or underreacting. I got fully sucked into the drama, and before I knew it, an hour had passed.

To protect your mental health, limit your social media intake to a specified amount of time and make use of blocking features. Twitter allows you to mute specific words — you might want to do this with “coronavirus” or “COVID-19” for 24 hours once a week, just to give yourself a break. Of course, it’s still important to stay informed, so follow official health organizations such as the WHO, CDC, and your local offices of emergency management, along with one national and one local news source. Check these sites twice a day max. While the news is constantly changing, obsessing over minute-by-minute updates won’t do you any good.

Prepare within reason

For peace of mind, stock up on two weeks of necessities — not 12 years worth of toilet paper. Cans of beans, soups, and boxes of pasta, oats, rice, and frozen vegetables store well. It will comfort you, just a little, to know you’ve prepared your home for a potential quarantine situation, allowing you to focus on more productive tasks.

Connect with others

In the days after 9/11, I spent a lot of time with my siblings and close friends. We were lucky in that we could hang out at bars and hug it out. Today, with social distancing, meeting up with others is not advisable, and even though I’m surrounded by my immediate family at home, I’m already feeling a little isolated.

So far, two things have been helping: connecting with family and friends through video chat and spending time online with fellow creatives. I’m part of two writers’ groups on Slack where we read each other’s stories and share feedback. I’ve found that on stressful days, the act of pouring myself into someone else’s work provides me with a sense of normalcy and purpose.

Binge on healthy distractions

In stressful times, it’s easy to turn to bad habits. To make sure you don’t, fill your environment with healthy distractions — good books, interesting podcasts, or maybe your yoga mat. These days, I keep The Selected Poems of Donald Hall with me at all times. The poems are quick to read and help me to refocus. Find something that stimulates your creative mind and stifles your urge to check your notifications yet again.

Put sacred time on your calendar

Each day, give yourself 30 minutes of solitude. (If you’re suddenly working from home, you’ve regained your commute time, so take advantage of it.) Turn off your phone. Take a walk. Meditate. Whatever you do, free yourself from any production goals. You can jot down interesting thoughts if they come to mind — they often do — but don’t make this a work session. Total disconnection allows you to check in with yourself and primes your brain for creativity.

Make something

If you’re a creative person, you might feel like your work is trivial right now. But it’s in times of uncertainty and fear that we depend on art to remind us that beauty and originality still exist. Creating something — whether it’s a painting or a pie or a podcast — can help you and others find order and make sense of a confusing world. It doesn’t matter whether what you make is good or not. The act of creation brings joy, a sense of pride, and helps you forget about the ills of the world, at least for a little while. In times of calm or panic, it may just be the most productive thing you can do.",https://forge.medium.com/how-to-be-productive-and-creative-in-times-of-panic-183ce6f253d8,Barry Davret,2020-03-13 15:40:24.048000+00:00,"Life Lessons,Health,Creativity,Coronavirus,Productivity"
Quora Overview,"Making the most of Quora for content marketing

There are several things you can do to boost your chance of having your blog posts receive attention on Quora:

1. Submit answers to popular questions: The most viewed and upvoted answers on Quora tend to have the highest potential to attract outbound traffic. It follows that you should seek out such answers to interact with in order to improve your chances of gaining meaningful traffic to your blog posts.

2. Create a strong profile: Having a solid profile allows you to stand out as well as boosts your credibility. Building a strong profile on Quora involves drafting a concise bio, completing your profile summary (which allows you to add clickable links, such as your blog), and including relevant topics into your bio.

3. Spend time crafting quality answers: The quality and accuracy of any answer you provide will determine whether you get upvotes or downvotes . Receiving downvotes can lead to your content being suppressed, so you want to spend time researching and writing answers that readers on Quora will appreciate.

4. Plug links to your blog posts: This is highly important. You need to remember to place links into your answers that lead back to your blog posts, which is the main way to get website traffic from Quora.

5. Share regularly: The more active you are on Quora, the greater your chances of getting strong viewership of your answers. More answers being viewed means increased exposure that could lead to people clicking back to your blog posts. How often you post is up to you, but some people recommend answering questions every day to build your reputation on the website.

Using Quora for content marketing purposes represents a win-win. On one hand, you get to help people find the answers they are looking for, while at the same time encouraging people to check out your content well into the future.",https://medium.com/digital-marketing-lab/quora-overview-99b7e217dd3a,Casey Botticello,2020-09-04 18:30:41.246000+00:00,"Productivity,Entrepreneurship,Writing,Startup,Social Media"
The Simple Formula For Becoming A Better Writer,"You Need To Show Up Every Single Day.

“The most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.” — Steven Pressfield

I used to be a master procrastinator in College. If my professor gave me a task to complete, I’d always find an excuse. I’d say it was too difficult, time-consuming, or anything else. And just like magic, someone more competent would do it for me.

I enjoyed sitting on the couch. I hated going outdoors. So I guess it’s no surprise that most people considered me to be extremely lazy. The only marathon I’d ever complete was a twelve-hour binge of my favorite shows on Netflix.

But then the cash in my bank account began to disappear. The truth is that I wasn’t making anywhere near enough money to support my lifestyle, so I needed to improve my work ethic.

The above quote from Stephen Pressfield changed my life forever. It made me realize that excuses are pointless. Why? Because nothing amazing will happen unless you sit down and do the work.

You don’t need a fancy keyboard, perfect lighting, or anything else a productivity guru might say. Instead, just open your laptop, connect to the internet, and write. That’s it.

Each morning, I get up at approximately 7am, go to my desk, and write a new article for several hours. Following this routine has helped me to remain consistent, create a daily writing habit, and generate a full-time income doing something I love.

If you want to improve your creative process, consider doing the same. Find somewhere quiet to work, and do your best to write something. Because when you show up every day to write, the power of compound interest will create incredible results over time.",https://medium.com/swlh/the-simple-formula-for-becoming-a-better-writer-4eca316cc7c7,Matt Lillywhite,2020-06-26 13:31:34.246000+00:00,"Creativity,Entrepreneurship,Blogging,Productivity,Writing"
AI creating Human-Looking Images and Tracking Artificial Intelligence Programs in 2020,"AI creating Human-Looking Images and Tracking Artificial Intelligence Programs in 2020

Machine Learning Transforming Veterans Benefits

The Dutch artist, Bas Uterwijk is using artificial intelligence to create human portraits from paintings by combining with deep learning to change statutes to human faces.

The same applies to paintings where the AI software includes photo attributes such as light and variations to make the picture clear. The Artbreeder AI program recreates new images from scratch by using data points, which copy the photos.

The global competitiveness of the United States in artificial intelligence is declining because of poor management at the Department of Defense. Tracking artificial intelligence programs and encouraging data sharing are needed to make the US a global leader in AI.

The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center is creating a standardized AI definition and developing governance policies around artificial intelligence.

Veterans face challenges claiming their benefits and a new machine learning application, Content Classification Predictive Service (CCPS), is spearheading efficient services and accuracy in handling veteran claims. Veterans wait for long as staff members check claims manually but CCPS can review information within a short time.

These and more insights on our Weekly AI Update

AI creating Human-Looking Images

Artificial intelligence is helping to create human-like portraits from statues and paintings of famous faces.

Bas Uterwijk a Dutch native artist used AI to create the photo-style portraits. He focused on well-known figures including Vincent Van Gogh and Napoleon Bonaparte. The #deeplearning technology enabled him to take a photo of a statue or a painting and turn it into a more human-like face. The software uses data points to pick up on facial features and photographic qualities.

The AI is called Artbreeder and can also create human-looking images from scratch. So far, they’ve worked on 50 to 60 of the AI-generated pictures¹. The artist is working on a model that could show Anne Frank at an age she never reached.

Tracking Artificial Intelligence Programs

Poor management of artificial intelligence projects in the Department of Defense could erode the United States’ competitive advantage in the emerging technology, the Defense Department’s watchdog warned in a July 1 report.

The DoD inspector general suggested the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, established to facilitate the adoption of artificial intelligence tools across the department, take several steps to improve project management, including determining a standard definition of artificial intelligence, improving data sharing and developing a process to accurately track artificial intelligence programs. The JAIC missed a March 2020 deadline to release a governance framework. It still plans to do so, according to the report, but that date is redacted in the report.

The inspector general started the audit to determine the gaps and weaknesses in the department’s enterprise-wide AI governance², the responsibility of the JAIC. After starting its audit, the DoD IG determined the organization had not yet developed a department-wide AI governance framework.

Machine Learning Transforming Veterans Benefits

Veterans deserve fast access to their disability benefits. The Department of Veterans Affairs is using a new #machinelearning tool³ to deliver these benefits to Veterans more quickly.

The tool’s name is not easy to remember — Content Classification Predictive Service (CCPS) Application Programming Interface (API) — but the results are certainly hard to ignore. VA’s Office of Information and Technology (OIT), working collaboratively in partnership with Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), developed and implemented CCPS to reduce the average time to establish Veteran disability compensation claims by three and a half days.

CCPS is also helping VA improve service to Veterans by increasing the speed and accuracy of disability claims reviews. The tool automatically performs repetitive tasks that formerly required staff review and input.

During its first week of use, CCPS helped VA establish 3,994 out of 8,368 claims (48 percent) automatically without the need for manual intervention. Previously, VBA only processed about two percent of disability compensation claims automatically.

Visual Causal Discovery Network

Researchers at MIT, University of Washington, and the University of Toronto describe an AI system that learns the physical interactions⁴ affecting materials like fabric by watching videos. They claim the system can extrapolate to interactions it has not seen before, like those involving multiple shirts and pants, enabling it to make long-term predictions.

Causal understanding is the basis of counterfactual reasoning, or the imagining of possible alternatives to events that have already happened. For example, in an image containing a pair of balls connected to each other by a spring, counterfactual reasoning would entail predicting the ways the spring affects the balls’ interactions.

The researchers’ system — a Visual Causal Discovery Network (V-CDN) — guesses at interactions with three modules: one for visual perception, one for structure inference, and one for dynamics prediction. The perception model is trained to extract certain keypoints (areas of interest) from videos, from which the interference module identifies the variables that govern interactions between pairs of keypoints.

Encouraging Growth in AI Research

The National Research Cloud, which has bipartisan support in Congress, gained approval of several universities, including Stanford, Carnegie Mellon and Ohio State, and participation of Big Tech companies Amazon, Google and IBM.

The project would give academics access to a tech companies’ #clouddata centers and public data sets, encouraging growth in AI research⁵. Although the Trump administration has cut funding to other kinds of research, it has proposed doubling its spending on AI by 2022.

The research cloud, though a conceptual blueprint at this stage, is a sign of the largely effective campaign by universities and tech companies to persuade the American government to increase government backing for research into #artificialintelligence largely due to its recognition that AI technology is essential to national security and economic competitiveness.

Artificial Intelligence assisted Robot Delivery

Refraction AI’s last-mile delivery robot⁶, the REV-1, has seen an increase in lunch delivery requests since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Unsurprisingly, this contactless delivery option is now seeing a demand surge amid the coronavirus pandemic: Refraction AI has received three to four times more orders with the REV-1 since the start of the pandemic.

The company, which first launched in July 2019, built the robot specifically for last-mile deliveries between stores and customers in urban communities like Ann Arbor, Mich., where the pilot program is now taking place.

Customers in the Ann Arbor community who live within the 2.5-mile delivery radius can sign up for REV-1’s pilot lunch delivery program that’s partnered with four three Asian and one Mexican restaurants, according to Refraction AI . There are also currently more potential partners still on a waitlist.

AI-enabled Robotics for Waste Recycling

When China restricted the importation of recyclable waste products in 2018, many western companies turned to robotic technologies to strengthen their processing capabilities. To recycle in a cost-effective, comprehensive and safe way, goods must be broken down into their constituent commodities to be sold on, in a process that has been likened to “unscrambling an egg”.

Roboticists think that computer vision, neural networks and modular robotics can enable a more intelligent, flexible approach to recycling. AI-enabled #robotics⁷ can identify items based on visual cues such as logos, colour, shape and texture, sorting them and taking them apart.

It can spot a Nestlé logo depicting a cow and surmise that it is a dairy product. Such systems excel at identifying small items, such as the coffee pods used in Nespresso machines, which, while technically recyclable, are not always recycled.

The Montreal AI Ethics Institute

The Montreal AI Ethics Institute, a nonprofit research organization dedicated to defining humanity’s place in an algorithm-driven world, today published its inaugural State of AI Ethics report⁸. The 128-page multidisciplinary paper, which covers a set of areas spanning agency and responsibility, security and risk, and jobs and labor, aims to bring attention to key developments in the field of AI this past quarter.

Credit: Zephyrnet

The State of AI Ethics first addresses the problem of bias in ranking and recommendation algorithms, like those used by Amazon to match customers with products they’re likely to purchase. The authors note that while there are efforts to apply the notion of diversity to these systems, they usually consider the problem from an algorithmic perspective and strip it of cultural and contextual social meanings.

The authors advocate a solution in the form of a framework that does away with rigid, ascribed categories and instead looks at subjective ones derived from a pool of “diverse” individuals: determinantal point process (DPP). Put simply, it’s a probabilistic model of repulsion that clusters together data a person feels represents them in embedding spaces — the spaces containing representations of words, images, and other inputs from which AI models learn to make predictions.

An Ethical Eye on AI

Researchers from the University of Warwick, Imperial College London, EPFL (Lausanne) and Sciteb Ltd have found a mathematical means of helping regulators and business manage and police Artificial Intelligence systems’ biases towards making unethical, and potentially very costly and damaging commercial choices — an ethical eye on AI.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly deployed in commercial situations such as using AI to set prices of insurance products⁹ to be sold to a particular customer. There are legitimate reasons for setting different prices for different people, but it may also be profitable to ‘game’ their psychology or willingness to shop around.

The AI has a vast number of potential strategies to choose from, but some are unethical and will incur not just moral cost but a significant potential economic penalty as stakeholders will apply some penalty if they find that such a strategy has been used — regulators may levy significant fines of billions of Dollars, Pounds or Euros and customers may boycott you — or both.

So in an environment in which decisions are increasingly made without human intervention, there is therefore a very strong incentive to know under what circumstances AI systems might adopt an unethical strategy and reduce that risk or eliminate entirely if possible.

Spearheading Data Science Initiatives

Princeton University researchers will push the limits of data science by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning across the research spectrum in an interdisciplinary pilot project made possible through a major gift from Schmidt Futures.

The Schmidt DataX Fund will help advance the breadth and depth of data science impact on campus, accelerating discovery in three large, interdisciplinary research efforts and creating a suite of opportunities to educate, train, convene and support a broad data science community¹⁰ at the University.

The Schmidt DataX Fund will be used to enhance the extent to which data science permeates discovery across campus and infuses machine learning and artificial intelligence into a range of disciplines. Many researchers and educators are eager to bring data science to their fields but lack the expertise, experience and tools.

The funds will support a range of campus-wide data science initiatives led by the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning, including: development of graduate-level courses in data science and machine learning; creation of mini-courses and workshops to train researchers in the latest software tools, cloud platforms and public data sets.

Neutralizing COVID-19 with Robotics

MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory is developing complex spaces easier to sanitize. Working closely with the Ava Robotics and the Greater Boston Food Bank (GBFB), CSAIL team created a UVC structure that disinfects surfaces and neutralizes coronavirus particles lingering in the air. Fitted atop an Ava Robotics base, the robot could be trained to navigate spaces #autonomously in the future.

The ultraviolet light works best on directly visible surfaces, but even reflected light in nooks and crannies is effective. During tests at GBFB’s warehouse, the prototype robot was teleoperated to get the lay of the land, but it’s equipped to navigate the area without supervision someday. The robot slowly moves through the 4,000 square foot warehouse, neutralizing 90 percent of coronaviruses¹¹ on surfaces within half an hour.

Deloitte AI Institute for Research and Applied Innovation

Evolution doesn’t give a damn what you think a brain region is called,"To evolution, the brain is just a gigantic bag of cells, wired together. The purpose of that gigantic bag of cells is to contribute to the survival of the organism in which it resides, to surviving long enough to reproduce. Those that reproduce, win; those that don’t, don’t.

If a random mutation causes or changes the wiring of some neurons to another group of neurons, and that mutation improves the chances of having offspring, it will likely spread through the population. If that random mutation adds connections from prefrontal cortex to visual cortex; from cortical interneurons to a structure outside cortex; from motor cortex to midbrain dopamine neurons, then it will happen. Evolution will not feel sorry that it’s just ruined another set of textbooks.

And it is just a giant bag of cells wired together. Our best evidence that it is not — that we can cling to our names of all the bits — come from studies where we cut a bit out or turn a bit off. When we cut out area X and we see a “deficit” in behaviour Y of an animal (like tying its shoelaces), then we think “aha! Area X is for tying shoelaces”. No. For starters, we never see a complete and permanent end to behaviour Y. We normally see that the animal is simply worse at doing or learning Y — not that it cannot do Y at all. The brain can carry on doing Y just fine, thanks, just not as well — there is massive redundancy in the brain. Like what you’d find if it was a giant bag of cells, wired together.

Moreover, seeing that behaviour Y gets worse logically tells us little about what area X is actually doing. It just tells us that damaging area X causes problems. Which on reflection isn’t surprising as you just ripped a chunk out of the brain. The logical fallacy is simple to demonstrate. I am right now going to make a new startling new prediction of how the mouse brain works: the ventrolateral medulla is necessary for mice to learn to associate pictures of Benedict Cumberbatch with food. Cut out the ventrolateral medulla, and a mouse will not learn to associate pictures of Benedict Cumberbatch with food.

Because it will be dead. The ventrolateral medulla contains the neurons which control the rhythm of breathing. Cut it out: no breathing. Ergo, no learning. Is the ventrolateral medulla a crucial brain area for learning? No. But by damaging it, we damage something vital to the process of learning. Thus, cutting a bit that we’ve given a name can have an effect on that named thing, and we learn nothing at all. Except that we have damaged a big bag of cells, wired together.

What’s more remarkable is when cutting bits out has no effect. If we cut some bits of brain out before learning we see an effect — learning is made slower or worse or both; but when we cut them out after learning, it has no apparent effect whatsoever. These bits of brain have become completely redundant. Again: giant bag of cells, wired together — there are many ways within that bag of cells to solve the problem at hand, enough for the brain to just stop using a bit of itself altogether.

And people get hyper-excited about finding odd signals where they were utterly unexpected. Like finding that reward changes activity in primary visual cortex. Or finding that sound is encoded in the hippocampus. These are great, interesting studies. But to be surprised by them is to fall into the naming fallacy. Evolution does not know nor care that we called this chunk of neurons the “hippocampus”. It is just another bag of neurons, connected to many other bags of neurons.",https://medium.com/the-spike/evolution-doesnt-give-a-damn-what-you-think-a-brain-region-is-called-1c9c5f80ab89,Mark Humphries,2020-06-07 18:40:02.586000+00:00,"Neuroscience,Psychology,Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning,Science"
"Is It Fear You Feel, Or Anxiety?","This article is not intended to be a rant against the news media or Facebook. As I try to do with all my writing, I just want to suggest the possibility of a different perspective. I also want to present some data that supports my differing perspective.

My hypothesis about the current state of malaise and despair that we see so often around us is this: we have little to fear, but much about which to be anxious.

To repeat: we have little to fear, but much about which to be anxious.

According to the American Psychology Association, fear and anxiety are two distinct mental states, caused by and causing different things:

Fear: n. a basic, intense emotion aroused by the detection of imminent threat, involving an immediate alarm reaction that mobilizes the organism by triggering a set of physiological changes. These include rapid heartbeat, redirection of blood flow away from the periphery toward the gut, tensing of the muscles, and a general mobilization of the organism to take action (see fear response; fight-or-flight response). Fear differs from anxiety in that the former is considered an appropriate short-term response to a present, clearly identifiable threat, whereas the latter is a future-oriented, long-term response focused on a diffuse threat.

To summarize, fear is an immediate alarm response to a real or perceived threat, which causes a distinct action. Anxiety is a long-term emotion which focuses not on a particular immediate threat, but a diffuse threat or threats that may or may not materialize, and which may or may not have a good response.

There are those among us who have good reason to fear the Coronavirus. And there are those with good reason to fear the economic meltdown going on right now. But I would argue that the state of confusion, panic and despair that we see so prevalent around us is not caused by fear, but anxiety.

Fear is a clean emotion. It comes, serves it’s purpose, and departs. Fear is a survival instinct. Using myself as an example, I am afraid of snakes. If I happen across one on a walk in the woods, I will immediately back up, get a safe distance before turning my back, and then run like hell until I feel safe again. That is fear. I do not spend all day everyday wondering if I will encounter a snake, and dreading going out because there might be a snake in my path today. That is anxiety. And that’s what we’re dealing with in the world today.

If anything, I would argue that it would probably be a good thing if more people feared the Coronavirus, because then they would be compelled to comply with social distancing and quarantine guidance. If more people truly feared the economic crisis, they would act to shore up their family’s wellbeing, they would make financial sacrifices before the next panic comes, and they would ensure they had a safety net in place.

But we are not truly afraid of these things, merely anxious. And as a result we do nothing, make no changes, learn no lessons, and so are doomed to repeat the same societal mistakes ad nauseum. Maybe, if we were more afraid and less anxious, we could put systems in place to provide better outcomes in the future.

Unfortunately, in addition to our own human tendency to lethargy and torpor, we also have to contend with a gigantic media establishment that feeds off of anxiety and keeping us trapped in a haze of confusion and inaction. We see evidence of this in the way we have systemically turned away from any kind of journalistic standard in news and prefer to get our information from bloggers, Facebook and Twitter influencers. Somehow, we’ve been conditioned to believe that we will hear the unvarnished truth from our “friends” on the Internet, and never question whether or not these so-called “friends” might not have an even more ingrained agenda than mainstream media does.

We are fed a constant stream of anxiety-fueling hot takes, breaking reports and opinion pieces disguised as news, much of it blatantly contradictory and even downright false, and we wonder why we can’t ever seem to feel any peace or confidence, in ourselves, our neighbors, and our social institutions.

Perhaps, as Franklin Roosevelt famously said, “the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.” because what’s eating America and the rest of the world from the inside out is not a clean, healthy survival instinct. It is a toxic, cancerous anxiety that is perpetuated by ourselves, that stops us in our tracks and renders us powerless in the face of some pretty fearful things.

To get better, we have to start by being more afraid, of the right things, to be afraid of inaction, to be afraid of a lack of preparation. To be afraid of paralyzing anxiety.

Only then can we turn and begin to make changes to improve our safety and security. For so long as we live in anxiety as a society, we will never be safe.",https://medium.com/thinkists/is-it-fear-you-feel-or-anxiety-84800061a2dc,Jay Michaelson,2020-03-23 01:14:51.987000+00:00,"Economy,Society,Mental Health,Psychology,Coronavirus"
Avoid Clickbait: Headline Techniques Used by Six Reputable Media Sites,"Avoid Clickbait: Headline Techniques Used by Six Reputable Media Sites

Yes, you can draw in traffic without clickbait. Practical examples included

Illustration by Cynthia Marinakos.

As I write this piece on the 19th of December 2020, Internet Live Stats has clocked over 4.5 billion Google searches. Roughly 306.4 billion emails were sent and received each day worldwide, according to statista.com.

With so many people searching for information and receiving emails, it’s tough to break through the avalanche of content. Writers know they have to stand out with their headlines. It can be tempting to write headlines that seduce our potential readers with general statements. If this is what it takes to draw a little traffic to our work, why not?

How do you feel when you see countless headlines like these?

Too many headlines like these are like buying a car from a used-car salesman. They might look great and sound like a good price. Yet we realize we’ve been duped soon afterward with a lemon. We can’t help but feel betrayed, angry. Our time has been wasted. And we’ll never buy from that place or that person again. What’s worse, we’re more likely to be skeptical of all used-car salesmen in general and buy directly from buyers instead.

Clickbait headlines are headlines that bait readers into clicking by teasing, being intentionally vague, or deceptive in their promises.

Clickbait has been a significant issue in journalism. In 2015, Trinity Mirror, one of the UK’s biggest newspaper publishers announced plans to set website “click” targets for reporters. This led to concerns that headlines with a constant you won’t believe what you’re about to read approach is frustrating to online readers and would diminish the value of news with fluff and sensationalism. Unsurprisingly, these plans didn’t go ahead.

Reputable media sites are wary of clickbait as they understand it damages the credibility of their content, their brands, and doesn’t serve their readers. These sites are now valuable places to learn how to avoid clickbait headlines. Especially as writing headlines isn’t a science. As writers, we can get better with our own headlines by identifying common characteristics behind headlines written by reputable media sites: BBC News, The Guardian, The New York Times, TIME, NBC News, and CBC.",https://medium.com/better-marketing/avoid-clickbait-headline-techniques-used-by-six-reputable-media-sites-dd04a5595cae,Cynthia Marinakos,2020-12-21 15:32:22.684000+00:00,"Marketing,Headline Hacks,Productivity,Startup,Writing"
"How a Single Medium Article Received 100,000 Views","Many Medium writers are looking for exposure. While making money from the Medium Partner Program is a nice bonus, they primarily want their content to be seen and accessible.

The good news is — if you are a writer, as described above — it is actually very simple to generate massive traffic for your Medium story.

Medium has extremely high Domain Authority (95/100).

Medium Domain Authority | Casey Botticello

Domain authority is a score that hints at the “strength” and relevance of a website for a specific subject area or industry. It’s a logarithmic scale of points, typically ranging from zero to 100, which predicts how well a website will rank on search engine result pages (SERPs). The higher the number of points, the higher a website’s Domain Authority is.

This means that any content you publish from Medium is already given preferential treatment in search engines. This establishes the potential for large amounts of external traffic to your Medium article.

The Article with Over 100,000 Views

The article that I wrote which received over 100,000 views is How to Bypass Virtually Every News Paywall:

It’s not surprising that this article generated a decent amount of views because it was a timely answer to a popular online question. But it is surprising that it generated so many views.

How did this Medium article accomplish this?

It leveraged Medium’s high domain authority and created content that was attractive to search engines.

A staggering 97% of the total views received by this article were from external traffic sources. The vast majority of these external sources are search engines. Google alone, generated well over 80,000 views. Even less common search engine like DuckDuckGo generated over 1,000 views.

Did this happen overnight? No. Even the best content will take weeks, if not months to achieve its optimal rank in most search engines.

As you can see from the screenshots of my Medium article analytics, below, the article initially saw a surge of traffic a few days in.

Traffic then remained flat for over a month before it jumped from being completely overlooked (Google Search Results Page 10+) to being somewhat accessible (Google Search Results Page 3–5). Also worth noting, the article was almost immediately indexed in Google after publication due to: (1) Medium being a publishing platform with high domain authority; (2) The initial surge of traffic ensured it would be indexed quickly.

As the article oscillates in page rank in Google’s search algorithm, daily traffic continues to grow at a steady rate:

Now, in May and June, several months after the initial article was published, traffic is still consistently growing with approximately 1,000 views per day!

What caused this? Primarily, views continued to grow at a fairly steady pace as the article climbed page rank in Google’s search engine. It gradually reached the bottom of the first page, then the number one spot on page 1, and finally it started becoming the featured snippet (position 0) in Google’s Search results.

How to Optimize Your Medium Article’s Search Engine Performance

Google’s algorithm evaluates a number of “on-page” factors to determine what a page is about. These on-page ranking factors include the following:

Title

Subheadings

Meta description

URL

The content of the article

Image tags

Medium provides writers with the ability to include a target keyword in each of these fields. If you want to generate huge amounts of external views, it is essential to optimize each of these fields.

Title

A title tag is an HTML element that specifies the title of a web page. Title tags are displayed on search engine results pages (SERPs) as the clickable headline for a given result, and are important for usability, SEO, and social sharing. The title tag of a web page is meant to be an accurate and concise description of a page’s content.

Google typically displays the first 50–60 characters of a title tag. If you keep your titles under 60 characters, our research suggests that you can expect about 90% of your titles to display properly. There’s no exact character limit, because characters can vary in width and Google’s display titles max out (currently) at 600 pixels.

of a title tag. If you keep your titles under 60 characters, our research suggests that you can expect about 90% of your titles to display properly. There’s no exact character limit, because characters can vary in width and Google’s display titles max out (currently) at 600 pixels. Avoid titles that are just a list of keywords or repeat variations of the same keyword over and over. These titles are bad for search users and could get you into trouble with search engines. Search engines understand variations of keywords, and it’s unnecessary and counterproductive to stuff every version of your keyword into a title.

According to Moz’s testing and experience, keywords closer to the beginning of your title tag may have more impact on search rankings. In addition, user experience research shows that people may scan as few as the first two words of a headline. This is why they recommend titles where the most unique aspect of the page (e.g. the product name) appears first. Avoid titles like:

Brand Name | Major Product Category — Minor Product Category — Name of Product

Titles like this example front-load repetitive information and provide very little unique value at first glance. In addition, if search engines cut off a title like this, the most unique portion is the most likely to disappear.

Subheadings

A subheading, or subhead, are mini-headlines and play a huge role in capturing and holding the scanners attention. It also keeps them moving down the page from one subhead to the next.

The subheading would ideally be:

Useful — it shows a promise and a benefit to the reader.

— it shows a promise and a benefit to the reader. Unique — it contains a fact or opinion your reader may not be aware of.

— it contains a fact or opinion your reader may not be aware of. Ultra-specific — this makes a subheading stand out and demand attention.

— this makes a subheading stand out and demand attention. Urgent — urgency gets your reader to take notice and action.

Meta Description

The meta description is an HTML attribute that provides a brief summary of a web page. Search engines such as Google often display the meta description in search results where they can highly influence user click-through rates.

Meta descriptions can be any length, but Google generally truncates snippets to ~155–160 characters. It’s best to keep meta descriptions long enough that they’re sufficiently descriptive, so we recommend descriptions between 50–160 characters.

A page’s meta description should intelligently (read: in a natural, active, non-spammy way) employ the keywords that page is targeting, but also create a compelling description that a searcher will want to click. It should be directly relevant to the page it describes, and unique from the descriptions for other pages.

URL

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator), more commonly known as a “web address”, specifies the location of a resource (such as a web page) on the internet. The URL also specifies how to retrieve that resource, also known as the “protocol”, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.

A well-crafted URL provides both humans and search engines an easy-to-understand indication of what the destination page will be about.

URLs are a minor ranking factor search engines use when determining a particular page or resource’s relevance to a search query. While they do give weight to the authority of the overall domain itself, keyword use in a URL can also act as a ranking factor.

Well-written URLs can serve as their own anchor text when copied and pasted as links in forums, blogs, social media networks, or other online venues.

Article Content

On the Internet, content sends signals to visitors and search engines about the quality and purpose of a site. Good writing, images, and other forms of content help visitors engage with a site and can build trust. Meanwhile, duplicate content and keyword-stuffed copywriting can indicate that a site is low-quality or even spammy. Content, especially when created according to a defined content strategy, is a cornerstone of effective digital marketing.

Keyword Research : If you want to generate traffic through search, it’s best to do keyword research before you start writing. This way, you can focus on keywords for which a certain amount of search volume already exists — in other words, write toward topics (or find keyword niches!) that people are already searching for information about.

Image Tags

Up until recently, Medium did not allow proper image tagging. However, a few weeks ago, Medium added alt-text functionality, which allows writers to properly tag their images.

If you’re creating content on a topic that requires the support of visuals, consider how your audience might prefer to find answers to their questions on that topic. In many cases, Google searchers don’t want the classic blue, hyperlinked search result — they want the image itself, embedded inside your webpage.

One of the most important things image alt text can do for you is turn your images into hyperlinked search results — giving your website yet another way to receive organic visitors.",https://medium.com/blogging-guide/how-a-single-medium-article-received-100-000-views-8bf030e7ce03,Casey Botticello,2020-04-04 00:57:03.881000+00:00,"Social Media,Writing,Productivity,Entrepreneurship,Journalism"
A Marketing Guide for Introverts,"An introvert is a person who recharges when they are alone. Being around other people depletes their energy, being by themselves renews it.

Writing is such solitary, interior work that it tends to attract introverts. We work well alone. And if we happen to have a little bit of ambivert in us — if we like to be around other people some — well, that’s okay. We have our characters to keep us company.

But it’s very, very rare to find a writer who gets excited about the part of the business of writing that requires a more extroverted personality. You know, the part where you have to stick your nose out of your writing cave and let other humans know you’re alive.

Uh, huh. Marketing.

Ugh. Marketing. It’s hard for everyone, but for introverts? For introverts, marketing is torture.

Every now and then I come across someone for whom the stars have aligned and they’ve managed to find success (sometimes incredible success) without the need for a lot of marketing and they just kind of shrug and say Oh, marketing? I don’t like it, so I just don’t do it. I don’t think it’s necessary.

And I want to throat punch them. Metaphorically. Because I wouldn’t really throat punch anyone. I’m a pacifist.

But come on.

One percent of writers write the right thing at the right time and get it out in the right place, in front of the right people, and bam! Magic happens. They get rich and famous and they never have to market anything.

How nice for them. But counting on being one of those people is not a very good career plan.

It’s kind of like deciding you want to be an actress, so you start to hang out in soda shops, hoping to be discovered because it worked for Lana Turner.

I really wish that the people who managed to find their way onto that magical path would at least acknowledge that it probably won’t work for almost anyone else. Because it won’t.

Ninety-nine percent of writers have to learn how to market, even if they are introverts who would rather seriously consider a career in accounting than think about marketing their own work.

Here’s what you need to know about marketing.

It’s not so scary.

Marketing is just a conversation between you and your readers. If you can remember that, then you can manage your fear about it. It’s not a magic trick. It’s not a technique or a tactic or a strategy.

It’s just a conversation.

It’s you reaching out to readers who are into what you’re writing and letting them know that you’ve written a thing that they might be interested in. That’s all. And that’s not so scary.

When you post a link to social media, you aren’t bothering anyone. You’re giving other people the opportunity to read something they might enjoy. If they aren’t into it, they’ll scroll past. No harm done.

And trust me, they’ll scroll. (Same as you scroll past hundreds of links a day. Maybe thousands.)

When you run an ad, you’re reaching out to other people just like you.

You aren’t shoving your work up their noses. You aren’t being pushy or obnoxious. You’re doing what you’re supposed to do. You’re letting readers know that you’ve written something for them.

And if you do it right, you’re letting readers who have asked to be made aware know that you’ve written something. You’re not bombarding everyone in creation. You’re putting your link in front of people who follow you or who have read other things like what you’ve written or who are interested in your topic.

Deep breath. This is part of your job, and it’s okay to do it.

Readers are just people.

That’s all. They are just human beings, same as you.

And, here’s the cool part. The ones you most want to reach are probably a lot like you. If you’ve written a book, it’s probably the kind of book you like to read. And if you’d like to read it, then that means that other people like you would probably like to read it.

So all you have to do is think for a minute about how someone who has written a book like yours could reach you.

What would make you want to read your own book?

What makes you tell a friend oh, my God, you have to read this?

What makes you click a link, instead of scrolling by?

What makes you share?

The reason why marketing gets a bad rap is because so many people use it like a sledgehammer, when really, it’s more like a Post-it note. No one wants to get smashed over the head. But who doesn’t want the exact right thing stuck right where they need it?

Introverts have trouble being sledgehammers. All we want to do is go home and get in our pajamas! We don’t want to hit anyone over the head with our books or anything else.

But we can stick a little reminder in the right place. A friendly little note that says Oh, hi! I wrote this thing. I think you’re going to love it.

And sometimes the sledgehammer is easy to ignore — because we’re so used to dodging them. But those sticky notes, man. If you use them right, they’re wonderful. They make you pay attention.

Don’t be slimy.

This should be obvious, but we both know it’s not.

We know, because there are so many people out there willing to take $299 from us to teach us how to be slimy.

You don’t have to trick people into buying your book. You don’t have to slip in under the radar. You don’t need to get fake bestseller statuses or elevate your social validation or whatever.

Authenticity is addictive. It’s your best asset.

When you spend money, make it count.

If you’re an indie writer, learn how to use Amazon ads properly. Dave Chesson has a free course in how to that over at Kindlepreneur.

The best money you can spend as a writer is on a decent email server. I like Convertkit. Start building your email list today. I’ve written a ton about email list building for writers, but you can start here.

Bryan Harris at Growth Tools (they used to be Videofruit) has a ton of amazing ideas for email list building that he offers for free. Just free. When I first started, I just took Bryan’s ideas one at a time and did the work.

It was hard. Because I’m an introvert and none of this shit is easy for me. But I did it and it worked. And it got easier.

You do not need to spend a lot of money on fancy ads or on schemes to make yourself a “bestseller” in a boxed set or hiring publicists. You do not need more than a simple website that you are probably capable of building yourself .

Hello, there. You should be blogging.

You’re a writer. Words are your currency and your most available tool.

I feel like I’m stating the obvious here, but you should be blogging.

If you’re a novelist, you might get a book into your reader’s hands once a year give or take. Maybe. But with a blog, you can reach out to your readers any time you want to. Every week. Every day. Every time you have an idea.

You can be in conversation with them. And let me tell you, that’s some exciting stuff. It’s thrilling. If you give you readers a way to start following you, you’ll start to notice that some of them are hardcore. They always show up for you.

They read what you write. They always read what you write.

If you have any doubt that your introverted self needs that, let me help you put that at rest.

You need it. Everyone needs it. It’s the good stuff.

It’s why we’re here. It’s why you’re reading this article instead of happily writing in your journal or filing your short stories away on your hard drive.

It’s why you care whether or not anyone reads your work.

While we’re on the subject, please do not only blog about your own writing. No one wants to read that. It’s boring.

If you don’t believe me, ask yourself this question: How many author blogs do you read that only talk about the author’s process?

Right.

You are an interesting person. There are things you’re interested in. You’re good at things. There are things you want to be good at. Write about those things.

You’ll find your people. I promise.

Remember that marketing has nothing to do with the quality of your work.

If you find yourself saying if I was good enough, I wouldn’t need to market I want you to do something for me.

Go to a mirror and look yourself squarely in the face. Now tell yourself to stop it. Right now.

You are wrong. And I swear, this is one of those times when if everyone would just listen to me, the world would be a happier place. Because there is exactly zero correlation between the quality of your work and the necessity for marketing.

The fact that you need to market your work does not mean that you’re a shitty writer, just because you heard once that someone else doesn’t have an email list and never markets anything.

Everyone needs to market their work. The very, very few lucky souls who have somehow been able to count on luck to give them a career — we can’t recreate their success.

Hell, they can’t recreate their success.

That means that you’re normal and they’re weird.

Since you can’t predict being at the exact right place at the exact right time with the exact right piece of work — you’re going to have to count on your own ability to let people know you’ve written a thing.

If you do manage to get struck by lightning, awesome. But two things. One — since you didn’t hitch your wagon to that star, you won’t be dependent on it, so if at some point it stops dragging you along, you’ll be fine. Two — even those lucky few who don’t have to market their work would do even better if they knew how to reach out to their readers.

I mean, do you really, really want to be the writer who gets to be famous and never has to interact with the people who love them? Are you sure about that?

Because that sounds pretty lonely to me. There’s a difference between lonely and introverted.

It also sounds like the excuse we use to let ourselves off the marketing hook because marketing is hard, especially for introverts, and we don’t want to do it.

The need to market your work doesn’t make you less of a writer, because there is no correlation between the quality of your writing and the need or lack of need for marketing.

If you don’t believe me, go pick up a copy of 50 Shades of Grey. Or go pick up any National Book Award winner that’s sold less than 5000 copies.

It’s okay to focus on the parts that are easier for you.

I like blogging. I’m pretty good at Facebook. I adore my email list. Email marketing is my sweetspot. When I reach out to my email list, I feel like I’m talking to friends.

I suck at video, but I’m working at it and I’m getting better. If there are other people there, I can do it pretty well. I still haven’t mastered video when it’s just me talking into a camera. I end up sounding like a lunatic.

I can do an ad if I have to, but I’m not a great copywriter.

That’s my skillset. Yours is probably different.

And that’s okay. No one is good at everything. And no one has to be.

If you’re great at audio, then do audio. If video is your thing, figure out how to market with video. If you’re completely inexperienced, pick something and just start. It’s okay if you suck at the beginning.

Here’s a secret for you: in the beginning, no one’s paying attention anyway.

The few people who will see your early efforts at marketing won’t care if you screw up. So take a deep breath and don’t worry so much. Stick your nose out of your introverted writer’s lair and accept that you’re going to have to give some form of marketing a shot.

You’ll get better at this.

It might not seem like it now, but marketing is a skill and like any other skill, the more you do it, the better you’ll get at it. Even if the idea of marketing makes you want to hide under your covers.

Eventually you’ll understand how ads work. You’ll be a master blogger. You’ll know how to write an email to your followers without sounding like a robot. You’ll look up one day and realize that you actually like that conversation between you and your readers.

Maybe it won’t ever be your favorite thing. Maybe you’ll dream about the day when you’re rich and famous enough to pass it off to someone else. (But, when you get there, you’ll only have more marketing to do!)

But you will get better at it.

How to Add Upscribe Forms to Your Medium Posts,"I’ve been asked several times how to add email sign-up forms to Medium blog posts, so I thought I’d write up a quick little how-to.

The Big Question: Yes. Medium allows forms behind the paywall.

I emailed Medium a while back to ask if it’s okay to put an email sign-up form on posts that are part of the Medium Partnership Program.

Here’s the response I got:

So. Quick and to the point. Thanks, Tobias!

What that means is that you can get paid for Medium posts, even if they include an Upscribe form.

Since the only purpose of an Upscribe form is to capture email addresses, Medium will allow you to invite readers to your list via a form on a post behind the paywall.

My feeling is that because Medium’s guidelines include the note below, they’ve left it open for them to remove your post from the Partnership Program (meaning, your post would not be behind the paywall and you wouldn’t be paid — but your post would still be available to read) if they decide that there’s too much marketing going on.

From Medium’s guidelines.

Medium strives to provide paying members with an ad-free reading experience. Part of that means they keep posts that explicitly ask for money (including claps or donations — for instance linking to a commercial site like Etsy) are not allowed.

Posts With Forms Are Allowed, But Not Often Curated

This is my own personal experience — so take it with a grain of salt.

It seems to me that Medium allows forms, for sure. I’ve had email confirmation and I’ve never had a post with a form in it either removed from the partnership program or brought to my attention as a violation.

That said, though, my posts with forms are rarely (almost never) curated. Which means they are not as well distributed by Medium as posts that don’t have a form.

The posts that include a form and are curated always include forms that are directly linked to the post. For instance, a form that promises something directly linked to the post you’re writing.

For instance, if I’m writing about a tool that I’ve developed for writers, I can include a form a reader can use to get a free copy and Medium might still curate that post.

Including that form, though, makes it much more likely that my post will not be curated.

So, I have to be conscious of the purpose of my post. Sometimes I write something that I know will convert well to my email list and it’s worth it to have a form, even if it means forgoing curation. Sometimes I want my posts to have wider distribution and the form isn’t worth it.

How To Use Upscribe to Post Forms on Medium

Okay, here’s the how-to part.

Go to Upscribe and sign up. There is a free version that allows you 100 form views per month and does not include integration with your email server. It costs $9 per month for up to 5000 views per month and integration.

Integrate Upscribe with your email server. To do that, click ‘integrate’ at the top of the screen. Choose your server and follow the directions. Upscribe will walk you right through it.

Once you’re integrated, you can set Upscribe so that your new form connects directly to your email server and you won’t have to manually upload new subscribers to your email list.

Click ‘Create New Form’ to start building your form. It’s super easy to design your form. Just change the wording. Click save. And that’s it. Your form is ready to use.

Post your form. You can either post your form directly on Medium or hyperlink text to a form that will open in a new tab.

To post your form directly, copy the link Upscribe provides. Past it where you want your form to appear. Hit your enter key. The form will automagically populate.

When you go to the ‘my forms’ page on Upscribe, you’ll see all your forms. Each one has a ‘copy link’ button. Just click that button, then paste the link into your Medium post where you want the form to show up.

So when I paste this link:

https://upscri.be/e1292d/

And then hit enter, this form shows up:

Voila. (That’s a live form.)

Alternatively, you can write text inviting people to join your list. When you highlight it, a small bar will pop up with a link symbol. Click that and input the link you copied from Upscribe.

For instance: Join the waiting list for my workshops.

The Power of Sleep in Learning: Mind-Blowing Science,"The Power of Sleep in Learning: Mind-Blowing Science

Many people, sadly, haven’t unlocked this potential their whole lives

W e all know sleep is important for (mental) health, but what do the numbers say?

According to the book:

Sleeping well can boost your learning with 20 to 40% in comparison to those who are sleep-deprived.

The problem, however, is that it’s hard for long-term sleep-deprived people to know they are sleep-deprived. However, according to the book, just 1 hour of less sleep for 10 nights is sufficient to make your performance equivalent to someone who is drunk. This includes driving, learning, reaction time, and so on.

One hour of less sleep every day, sadly, is a reality for many people and especially students.

So how does sleep enhance learning?

The Mechanics of Sleep In Learning

First of all, as we progress throughout the day learning new stuff, they are mostly stored in the hippocampus. This brain region, however, has a relatively small space to store memories and can get full quickly.

What happens during sleep, is that these memories either get transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex (which has a much bigger storage space) or they get removed.

See: Memory consolidation, Wikipedia for more information

A lack of sleep results in your hippocampus not being completely emptied (or almost) nor are your memories that well consolidated (strengthened). This, in turn, makes it harder to learn and remember new things the next day.

Sleep and Productivity

I f you had to choose between earning $80,000 a year while working normal hours and getting good sleep versus $140,000 while working insane hours and only sleep 6 hours a day, what would you choose?

Most people would choose the latter. The book, however, teaches that you can get both in the long-term, namely earning $140,000 while sleeping well every night.

Why? Because you make less errors, are much more creative, and so on when having slept well.

This, too, counts for studying and learning things.

Don’t sacrifice quality for quantity.

AI analyzes language to predict schizophrenia,"A machine learning method uncovered a hidden clue in people’s language predictive of the later manifestation of psychosis: the frequent use of words associated with sound. A paper published by the journal npj Schizophrenia released the findings by scientists from Emory University and Harvard University.

Hidden details

The researchers developed a new machine-learning methodology to more precisely quantify the semantic richness of people’s conversational language (a known indicator for psychosis). Their results indicated that automated analysis of the two language variables (more frequent use of words associated with sound and speaking with low semantic density, or vagueness) can predict if an at-risk person will later develop psychosis with an impressive 93 percent accuracy.

Trained clinicians had not noticed how individuals at risk for psychosis use more words associated with sound than the average population, though abnormal auditory perception is a pre-clinical symptom.

“Voices: Living with Schizophrenia” by WebMD, YouTube.

Machine learning can spot patterns in people’s use of language that even doctors who have undergone training to diagnose and treat those at risk of psychosis may not notice. “Trying to hear these subtleties in conversations with people is like trying to see microscopic germs with your eyes,” says first study author Neguine Rezaii, a fellow in the Department of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. That being said, it is possible to use machine learning to find subtle patterns hiding in people’s language. “It’s like a microscope for warning signs of psychosis,” she adds. Rezaii started working on the study while she was a resident in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University School of Medicine.

“Trying to hear these subtleties in conversations with people is like trying to see microscopic germs with your eyes,” Neguine Rezaii, fellow in the Department of Neurology at Harvard Medical School.

Behind the data

Researchers first used machine learning to establish “norms” for conversational language. They fed a computer software program the online conversations of 30,000 users of Reddit, a popular social media platform where people have informal discussions about a wide array of sujects. The software program, known as Word2Vec, utilizes an algorithm to change individual words to vectors, assigning each one a location in a semantic space based on its meaning. Such with similar meanings are positioned closer together than those with different meanings.

They also developed a computer program to perform “vector unpacking,” or analysis of the semantic density of word usage. Previous work has measured semantic coherence between sentences. Vector unpacking enabled the researchers to quantify how much information was packed into each sentence. After generating a baseline of “normal” data, the researchers applied the same techniques to diagnostic interviews of 40 participants that had been conducted by trained clinicians, as part of the multi-site North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS), funded by the National Institutes of Health.

Vector unpacking enabled the researchers to quantify how much information was packed into each sentence.

The automated analyses of the participant samples were then compared to the normal baseline sample and the longitudinal data on whether the participants converted to psychosis.

Should You Stay In Your Lane as a Writer?,"Stay in your lane can mean a couple of things.

Sometimes it means minding your own business. Keeping your head down and just doing your own thing and not worrying about what other people are doing.

Sometimes it means staying within the boundaries of a field of focus — especially if you’re an entrepreneurial type. Being a specialist, instead of a jack-of-all-trades.

It’s one of those platitudes that kind of hits me wrong — but also sort of makes sense.

I mean, if you know what it is you want to do, it makes sense to focus on that and do it really well. Willy nilly branching out can be problematic.

I’ve had friends try so hard to make a go of writing and fail because they couldn’t settle into a groove.

But I kind of hate the idea of someone else telling me that I have to stay in my own lane. Especially with regard to writing.

One of the things I love about blogging is that I can write about any old thing that comes to my mind and there isn’t anyone to tell me I can’t.

And if Neil Gaiman can write everything from picture books to books for adults, why can’t I?

Maybe I won’t have as many readers when I write about certain topics. Maybe I won’t be paid as much. But if I learn something or I enjoy myself or have an interest in establishing myself in that lane (so to speak) then that’s okay.

For writers, I think there’s room for both having a lane — or a niche — and also exploring outside of that lane.

The key is to know where your lane is, so that you can branch out on your own terms.

If you’re a non-fiction writer, your lane is the topic or topics that you write about regularly and with authority.

For instance, my non-fiction writing lanes are writing in general, but especially fiction writing. Also online business, productivity, and the business of writing.

If you’re not sure, or you’re a new writer, ask yourself these questions:

What are you good at?

What could you teach someone else?

What do people come to you for help with?

What do you spend your time learning?

What are you passionate about?

What topic did you read the most about last year?

One way to find your lane is to post this on social media:

What do you think I’m good at?

I get it. It’s going to feel seriously awkward. Like you’re fishing for compliments. But if you can’t figure it out for yourself, you’ll get some interesting responses if you’re brave enough.

If you’ve written blog posts already on a pretty broad array of topics, take a look at the analytics for them. Which are getting the most traffic? Which are getting the most interaction from readers?

Those posts are probably written in your lane.

Did you have fun writing them? This is an important question, because none of this matters if you’re not having fun.

Your lane is the lane where you want to be.

Let me say that one more time.

Your lane is the lane where you want to be.

Even if you are an absolute authority in a specific topic and you could teach the whole world something about it, if you don’t want to write about it, it’s not your lane.

You do not want to get yourself in a situation where you’ve built an audience who is expecting work from you on a specific subject and you’re making money writing on that subject — and you hate the work.

By the way, this goes for fiction writers as well. I’ve known fiction writers who’ve found success writing books they weren’t happy writing and struggled to shift gears.

That’s a trap that’s very difficult to get out of.

So, one more time for the writers in the back. Your lane is the lane where you want to be. Even if that’s not the lane where you are currently an expert.

We’re clear on that, right?

Changing Lanes Out of Impatience

Here’s what I see happen pretty often.

A writer starts writing on a subject they like a lot. They write a few posts. Or maybe they write an ebook. Or they write a novel. And they don’t get the kind of traction they want.

Nothing goes viral. Or they don’t make any money. (Or not as much as they thought they would) Or the book they self-published flops. Or they don’t get an agent.

So, they change lanes.

They start writing on a different topic. And nothing goes viral, etc.

They don’t feel like this lane works for them the way they want it to, either.

So they change lanes. Again.

The problem is that this person is trying to get from point A to point Z and they keep getting off at the first exit and going back to the start, then taking a different route.

They’re moving, and they’re logging miles, but they’re not actually making progress. They aren’t sticking with anything long enough to actually get good at it.

(Their starts might be getting better though, after doing them so many times. So there’s that.)

Here’s the thing about Neil Gaiman and his writing everything from picture books through adult novels. Somewhere in the beginning of his learning how to write, he stuck with something long enough to become a good writer. Then he branched out.

I remember reading that he had the idea for The Graveyard Book (a young adult book) for twenty years and had to wait until he was a good enough writer to actually write it.

Changing Lanes With Intention

What if, instead of changing lanes completely, because you’re impatient with how things are going, you changed lanes with intention.

You start out writing in your lane, about the topic that you’re very sure you want to write about. The lane you love.

Then, sometimes you branch out and add a new lane.

These are sometimes called shoulders, especially if they’re semi-related to the topic you’re already writing about. If I write about marketing, for instance, I’m writing in a shoulder lane to writing.

Writing middle grade is kind of a shoulder of writing young adult. It’s different, but not like crazy different.

But sometimes I write about my eating disorder. Or about taking care of my parents-in-law who both have Alzheimer’s and live with my husband and I. Or about being a soccer mom.

I’m knocking around an idea for a picture book about a spider that lives outside my office window.

Those are topics that are just entirely outside of my lane.

When I write on those topics, it’s because I have something I want to say. I know that those posts will get less traffic than blog posts that I write that are in my lane. But I don’t mind.

There are real benefits to leaving your lane sometimes.

Taking a break from my lane keeps you sharp. You might have to do research when you write about something you’re less familiar with. You’ll have to think in different ways. That’s good for your brain.

And you’ll find connections between the lanes sometimes that you never would have seen otherwise. That’s always very cool.

And it’s fun. It feeds the rebel soul.",https://medium.com/the-write-brain/should-you-stay-in-your-lane-as-a-writer-735517e5769b,Shaunta Grimes,2019-08-16 15:40:40.696000+00:00,"Creativity,Entrepreneurship,Productivity,Work,Writing"

How The Media Can Prevent Copycat Suicides,"How The Media Can Prevent Copycat Suicides

Responsible reporting around celebrity suicide goes a long way

Photo by Reagan Freeman on Unsplash

The celebrity death I was most impacted by was Chester Bennington. Chester was the lead singer of Linkin Park, my favorite band as a kid, and the lead behind my favorite songs that would play over and over again on my iPod: “Numb” and “In the End.” I was in Japan, working in an organic chemistry lab, but at the time, the news devastated me — Chester had died on July 20, 2017, by suicide.

But I had grown enough in my mental health awareness that I feared the media reporting and a possible contagion effect from that reporting. According to Gunn et al. in a 2018 study in the Archives of Suicide Research, widely publicized suicides like Robin Williams (2014) and Aaron Hernandez (2017) were associated with increased Google.com/trends data on “how to suicide” and “suicide prevention.” The authors attributed the increase in searches following Williams’s death to the Werther Effect, a spike of emulation or copycat suicides after a widely publicized suicide, and the death of Hernandez to the Papageno effect, an increase in awareness and support in suicide prevention.

The contagion effect is synonymous with the Werther Effect. The Werther effect, according to blogger Alexa Moody, was coined in the late 1700s after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s book, The Sorrows of Young Werther. In the book, the protagonist, Werther, finds himself in a love triangle and believes the only way to make it out is through suicide — although the book was widely commercially successful, the success of the book led to many copycat suicides of fans of Goethe deciding to take their own lives as well.

The Papageno effect is on the opposite side of the spectrum. Its etymology is after a character Mozart’s “The Magic Flute,” where a character loses his love and plans suicide as a result. The attempt is stopped last minute by three boys who support him and tell him there are alternatives to suicide and is a positive effect the media can have on suicide.

When Chester Bennington died, suicide experts feared a contagion effect. Zach Schonfeld in Newsweek reports that Bennington’s death shocked people since many believe that wealthy and successful people don’t struggle with depression and anxiety, like other people. But depression is a disease that can affect anyone. In the words of Theresa Buhse, the associate executive director of the Long Island Crisis Center:

“Just because somebody is rich and famous does not necessarily mean that they’re happy at all…The truth is, we never know what is going on in somebody’s mind. People struggle with mental illness. People struggle with depression. It doesn’t matter how rich they are. It doesn’t matter how famous they are. We don’t know what’s going on.”

Chester’s death was its own example of the contagion effect. Chester died on what would have been Cornell’s 53rd birthday, and Cornell also died by suicide years earlier. Buhse notes that it might have been a coincidence, but people also may plan out an emotionally significant date.

Celebrity suicides sometimes have a contagion effect on the general population as well. When Marilyn Monroe died from probable suicide in 1962, the suicide rate jumped by 12 percent compared to the same months the previous year. To this day, the death of Marilyn Monroe resulted in the most copycat suicide attempts. According to Margot Sanger-Katz in the New York Times, the publicity surrounding suicide has been linked with subsequent increases in suicide, especially for young people. Analysis suggests that at least five percent of youth suicides are influenced by contagion. What irresponsible media coverage does is harm people already vulnerable and at risk for suicide.

For the media to avoid the contagion, Sanger-Katz notes that suicide prevention advocates want news media coverage to avoid emphasizing or glamorizing suicide or make it seem like an inevitable solution for people at risk. Media reports also should not fixate on graphic details of the death, and in the case of Chester, one media source prominently highlighted his method of suicide.

1962 is very different from 2020, and the media has come a long way in being responsible and diligent. Schonfeld talks about the suicide of Kurt Cobain in 1994, where experts feared a nationwide copycat effect. However, media outlets reported warning signs and provided hotline numbers, and the number of suicides in the Seattle region decreased after Cobain died, assisted by a rise in calls to local crisis centers.

According to Luna Greenstein at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Anthony Bourdain’s suicide came only two days after the media irresponsibly reported on Kate Spade’s suicide.

Takeaways

To talk about suicide in a way that encourages people to get help and look for help, Greenstein recommends including local and national hotline numbers, as well as other crisis resources. Other recommendations include informing, not sensationalizing. Any headline of a celebrity’s death should not include suicide in the headline, and images of the method or location of death should be avoided. Instead, photos of school, work, or family can be used instead.

Greenstein also recommends choosing words carefully, using words like “increase” and “rise” rather than more sensational words like “epidemic” or “skyrocketing.” And terminology around suicide is important as well — the field is moving away from “committed suicide” and moving more around terms that do not stigmatize suicide as a crime, like “died by suicide,” “completed suicide,” “killed him/herself,” and “ended his/her life.”

Lastly, Greenstein recommends reporting on suicide as a public health issue. Suicide shouldn’t be reported the same way a crime is reported, and seeking advice from suicide prevention experts is more important than quoting police and first responders. Including the warning signs of suicide as well as a “what to do” sidebar.

“This is not a matter of being ‘politically correct.’ It’s a matter of saving lives,” Greenstein says.

We can also watch how we talk about suicide in personal circles as well using these guidelines. Just like obituaries talk mostly about how someone lived rather than how someone died, and although talking about suicide is difficult and often uncomfortable, suicide is the second leading cause of death for people aged 10 to 34 in the United States. Responsible reporting and conversation on suicide are essential.",https://medium.com/invisible-illness/how-the-media-can-prevent-copycat-suicides-6930d384c2ce,Ryan Fan,2020-12-28 19:23:39.017000+00:00,"Society,Mental Health,Journalism,Health,Medium"
Thoughts on a medical mystery,"Thoughts on a medical mystery

How brains learn diseases, and their cures

My father is a pediatric neurologist, with a speciality in epilepsy. He’s always loved the kids he worked with, and treated them like family. Whenever one of his patients died, he’d bring me and my sisters to their funeral. Some I’d known for years from tagging along on rounds, or having watched them grow up through the quanta of Christmas cards and back-to-school photos. I remember the funeral of a girl my age, who had been far more outgoing and lively than me, her now-dark face caked in yellow makeup. Though they’d never found a drug that could control her seizures, she’d seemed otherwise healthy and normal, and her death had come as a total surprise. This was my first brush with Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory seizures, and remains one of the most devastating mysteries in the field of epilepsy. There are currently no known biomarkers to identify patients at risk for SUDEP — hence the Sudden, hence the Unexpected.

Having come to neuroscience by way of physics, I confess I often forget a crucial point: neurons are cells, not just immutable contact points on a circuit board over which voltage plays in prescribed patterns. Not only is the circuit board layout shifting, always rewiring itself in learning, but activity sets off internal programs within cells, making them more or less active, or plastic, tuning their metabolism and protein production. Furthermore, at the gross level, the brain isn’t a black box sealed in the skull, but exerts its influence on every conceivable bodily process. Neurological disorders are rarely, if ever, confined to the brain. This may seem obvious, but it bears consideration. When brain areas are over or under-active, this can reverberate through other somatic systems, causing plastic changes in all manner of body parts: neurons love to learn. In fact, non-neuronal cells learn too: signals like oxygen or nutrition levels can alter a cell’s transcriptional landscape, resulting in tissue remodelling, for example.

Epilepsy is particularly interesting, as it’s a prime example of a learned disease. “Kindling” is a common idea in the literature: once someone has had one or more seizures, they’re much more likely to become epileptic, as the brain learns this problematic activity pattern. Some epileptic patients report that they’ve discovered certain thought patterns that help them control or minimize an oncoming seizure (these patients feel a pre-ictal ‘aura’ that clues them in), so we know there may be conscious strategies which certain patients can use to volitionally control their disease. But I’d argue that neural circuits may have evolved or learned other, less helpful ways of suppressing disease-related activity—in the case of uncontrollable epilepsy, through depriving the brain of oxygen, thereby quenching activity. I posit we might use this framing of brains and bodies ‘learning’ their own cures to better understand common comorbidities of neurological disorders.

SUDEP is a big clue in this. It’s increasingly evident that cardio-pulmonary issues underlie a majority of SUDEP cases. While most SUDEP events go unwitnessed, in a retrospective study of observed SUDEP cases caught while patients were in the hospital, researchers found that patient breathing ceased before heart failure in all 16 observed events (Rivlin et al., 2013). There is no doubt that SUDEP involves a complex network of effects, but the effect of repeated exposure to low oxygen levels (chronic intermittent hypoxia) is consistent with many of the known abnormalities of SUDEP patients (Giaccia, Simon, & Johnson, 2004). Hypoxia has a profound effect on tissues, from altering the physiology of certain ion channels in the heart and lungs to long-term changes in genetic transcription and vascular remodeling (Kemp & Peers, 2007; Ling et al., 2001; Nei, 2009; Richerson, 2010). Up to 40% of SUDEP cases present cardiac fibrosis in autopsy, which can be a result of chronic intermittent hypoxia (Ling et al., 2001; P-Codrea, et al., 2005), and damage was most commonly found in the heart structure most vulnerable to ischemic damage (the subendocardial myocardium, for the keen). SUDEP patients also tend to have had post-seizure cerebral depression, which is also strongly linked with hypoxia (Takano et al., 2007). All of this suggests that recurring low oxygen levels might be the cause of the myriad tissue and neural remodeling events that ultimately result in patient death.

The link between epilepsy and breathing problems is well documented, but not well understood. In some patients, epileptic activity may simply affect brain stem circuits controlling breathing. Every patient has a different locus of seizure activity — the part of the brain a seizure plays out on. But SUDEP doesn’t only happen in patients whose seizures originate in the part of the brain that controls breathing. There may be a more fundamental physiological link underlying seizures and breathing: blood acidification, as happens in hypoxic conditions, is anti-convulsive. Thus, the hypoxic response may not simply be a direct effect of a seizure on the brain stem, but an evolved mechanism, or one learned by neural circuits, to shut down epileptic activity during otherwise intractable seizures [1]. This then leads to a vicious cycle: breathing circuits are plastic throughout life, and strongly shaped by hypoxia (So, 2008), so even if a patient’s seizures never directly reach the brain stem, their chronic seizures could still cause a gradual degradation of the neural circuits controlling breathing through repeated hypoxia [2]. The brain, then, might be learning activity patterns that help control a particular disease state, which is adaptive in the short term but ultimately deleterious: a drastic stop-gap to manage otherwise intractable epilepsy.

The brain is sometimes too good at doing its job. Many neurological diseases involve some component of being ‘learned’ by neural circuits: chronic pain, neuropathy/neuralgia, and migraine all come to mind. When considering how to find predictive biomarkers for neurological conditions, or how to address their symptoms, it’s crucial to remember that neurological diseases don’t live in the brain alone. They can affect all body systems, and some of the most deleterious symptoms might result from the brain attempting to ‘medicate’ itself with whatever other systems it has control over. Studies with this framing in mind might help lead to the discovery of simple interventions, and further refine our understanding to identify functional and molecular biomarkers of medical mysteries such as SUDEP [3].

On writing with heart and hope

The words I do not recognize are the ones my heart wrote, so feverish with hope every line feels like a hallucination.

And yet, these moments happened and still happen, everything is true. Suddenly, life is poetry and joy opens up portal into new universes that leave you speechless. Unless you surrender to it, you cannot experience awe; that surrender is not verbal. Transcription takes place well after the facts and always feels like an unreliable witness account.

Finding yourself writing love letters to life as a chronic depressive freelancer on the verge of financial collapse is weird but I’m here for it. Against the stark backdrop of death and destruction, life is more beautiful than ever, and I am, dare I say it, content.

There is so much gentleness in the generosity of acceptance, it frees up mental bandwidth for everything else. The moment is as impermanent as life. To not celebrate it would be an affront to hope, the same hope that has seen me through everything so far.

I shouldn’t be here anymore but I am. Despair has shades and nuances, hope is blinding, and I have been dazed and confused since I set aside the past and embraced the present almost two years ago.

Hope is the blank page beckoning your heart to release its findings.

Do you get a little nervous before showing someone your artwork or writing? Before clicking publish or submitting to a publication?

I do.

There’s a certain level of fear that comes with being creative — Why?

We’re all a little suspect of our own talent — Ethan Hawke

This was the first thing that jumped out at me when I saw Ethan Hawke’s TED Talk about creativity. We’re hesitant when it comes to being creative.

Why?

We’re unsure about how we’ll be judged on our suspect talents. We’re insecure. Should we be? What are we so afraid of?

After all:

If history’s taught us anything, the world is an extremely unreliable critic.

Who knows what will be “popular” or “valuable” or “good”. Not us. We have no say in that.

Sure, there are “recipes for success” in creativity — I guess. Look no further than the countless writing advice posts on Medium. But do you want a recipe for someone else’s success, or do you want to blaze your own trail?",https://medium.com/afwp/allow-yourself-to-be-creative-dae5dab938e1,Mike Marolla,2020-10-31 15:33:23.749000+00:00,"Writing,Creativity,Motivation,Self-awareness,Art"
How To Rewire Your Brain To Succeed During Uncertain Times,"When you have a thought for the very first time, it passes and generally doesn’t have too much of an impact on you. However, when it is repeated, your subconscious begins to perceive it not as an observation, but as an important fact that needs to be embedded into the framework of your daily life — an idea that you should, at some level, be constantly aware of.

What we are most keen to adopt into that mindset are often worst case scenarios, deep fears, paralyzing insecurities, and anything else we imagine might possibly be a threat to us. Unfortunately, the majority of our daily actions, decisions and outcomes stem from that same place in your subconscious where all of that automation is being stored.

“What we’re doing is being driven by that automatic program,” Dr. Irvine says.

However, there is hope. She’s used the following process to train 7 and 8-figure earning entrepreneurs not only to achieve greater levels of career success, but to mend relationships, find deep fulfillment, and free themselves of “stressed success,” where you are accomplished on the surface, but unhappy just beneath.

Our job now, she says, is to do some serious inner-work.

How to remove limiting thoughts

Dr. Irvine explains that its the moments most of us avoid — tension, resistance, or cognitive dissonance — that offer us the greatest opportunity for change.

“At these times, we are actually aware of what we are saying to ourselves all along.” She uses the following four step process with her clients while coaching them to use challenges as opportunities for real and lasting change.

First, recognize the thought.

The biggest problem for most of us is that we aren’t even aware of what we are telling ourselves all day.

“Most high-performers go around and think, who am I to do this, most people have imposter syndrome,” Dr. Irvine explains. Then, they just try to out-work, disprove or avoid it. None of these tactics work, because by trying to suppress it, it stays automated.

Instead, we need to just get clear on what we are thinking, and ultimately, what we really believe about ourselves.

Second, record the thought.

Writing the thought down actually “pulls it out” of your subconscious, Dr. Irvine explains.

When people display resistance towards this, it is because of the idea that “what we focus on grows,” or that by writing it down, we are legitimizing or making it more real or likely than it was before. Not so.

“The reality is that it’s already running 80 to 90 percent of your day. There’s nothing more important than recognizing it for what it is.”

Third, refute the thought.

The best thing about our brains, she explains, is that as soon as we are aware of the thought, we will naturally begin to challenge it.

“By saying it out loud, we see it as the lie it is,” Dr. Irvine shares.

If that’s challenging, try to imagine someone you deeply love and care for (the kind of person you’d “jump in front of a bus for,” she says) and then picture saying the thought to them. What this does is remove your negativity bias, which she estimates has us believe 9 times more negative thoughts about ourselves than anyone else.

When we imagine applying the thought to someone else, we see how limiting and destructive it can be.

Fourth, record yourself speaking the new thought.

The final and most powerful step is to re-wire your thinking.

Dr. Irvine suggests doing so by actually recording yourself speaking your new ideas in the present tense (perhaps on your phone) and then listening to it in the morning and before bed. “You’re building a new network in your brain around the truth, around the old belief. You’re showing your subconscious that you’re not aligning with that anymore,” she says.

How to rewire your brain to succeed amid uncertainty

This process becomes vital during times of uncertainty, such as we are facing right now.

Our brain’s first instinct is to “seek the familiar,” Dr. Irvine says. “When everything changes and everything is uncertain and nothing is controllable, our brains are doing what they are wired to do, they are kicking into fight or flight mode… there’s a tiger in the room, so run,” she explains.

Her first advice is to limit our media intake.

“Pick one trusted source, someone reputable in nature, and check in once a day,” she explains, emphasizing that being informed is important. “But then be unavailable to it for the rest of the day.”

This is important because when we’re already triggered, we’re functioning from our sympathetic nervous system. We can’t focus, we can’t create. “This is why so many of us are so tired, so emotional right now. We are being flooded in neurochemicals. In order to re-wire your brain to succeed in certainty, we need to unplug from that,” she says.

Next, she suggests to make bold moves.

“Right now, we need to rise up in uncertain times more than we ever have. Now is the time to create the strongest vision you’ve ever had. We can’t control everything that’s going on around us, but we need to control our vision, and how vibrant and multi-dimensional that is. I am encouraging my clients, students and the people in my community to rise up,” she says.

Next, it’s time to pivot into leadership. Identify the things that need to start getting momentum. Is it going live on Instagram, updating a social media page, sending some emails? Just start taking action, she advises.

What if this comes off as insensitive?

One of the biggest challenges that dissuades people from taking action and leading during times of uncertainty is the fear that doing so will seem insensitive to the realities of our current predicament.

However, there is a way to lead mindfully.

“If we hold back and don’t put the thing out in the world that has the potential to change someone’s life, we are just being selfish,” Dr. Irvine explains. “Lead with your service, lead with your generosity, lead with your service, you are the thing that people are leaning toward, they need you right now.”

Challenges show us who is a problem-solver, and who is a problem-exacerbator.

Walking Is Underrated: The Unappreciated Complexity and Power of Walking,"Walking Is Underrated: The Unappreciated Complexity and Power of Walking

“Walking is man’s best medicine!”— Hippocrates

Even though moving around seem simple, it requires considerable brain power

In his book, ‘In Praise of Walking’ [1], Shane O’Mara starts off by talking about the life of a sea squirt.

In its early stages of development, it moves around in rock pools in search for food. To support this movement, the young sea squirt develops one eye, a brain, and a spinal cord.

As the sea squirt matures, it undergoes a major transition. It attaches itself to a rock, and never moves again.

It then eats its brain, eye, and spinal cord. Because it just doesn’t need them anymore.

But surely humans are not quite the same as sea squirts, right? We might be a little closer than you would imagine.

Developmental biologists compared the genes of two seemingly different species: the skate (a type of fish) and the mouse. The biologists discovered that the two species share many genes related to movement. These shared genes determine their spinal cords, the placement of their limbs or fins, and the nearby muscles and nerves [3].",https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/walking-is-underrated-the-unappreciated-complexity-and-power-of-walking-a7df7ffe5b04,Eshan Samaranayake,2020-12-22 02:58:38.151000+00:00,"Mental Health,Health,Neuroscience,Science,Fitness"
"House Reports Claims Anticompetitive Behavior by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook","“Our investigation leaves no doubt that there is a clear and compelling need for Congress and the antitrust enforcement agencies to take action that restores competition, improves innovation, and safeguards our democracy.” — Rep. David Cicilline

After reviewing more than 1.3 million internal documents and interviewing more than 240 people and three dozen antitrust experts, and former employees of the major tech companies, the House Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee wrapped up its 16-month investigation. The report concludes that Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook have exploited their power of the marketplace in anticompetitive ways.

“This investigation has revealed that Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google were committed to drowning out competition through unfair and anti-competitive practices — often doing so at the expense of user privacy and innovation,” said Rep. Val Demings. “Their anticompetitive acts have come at a cost for consumers and small businesses.”

In its report, the subcommittee recommended the following actions be taken:

Structural separations to prohibit platforms from operating in lines of business that depend on or interoperate with the platform;

Prohibiting platforms from engaging in self-preferencing;

Requiring platforms to make its services compatible with competing networks to allow for interoperability and data portability;

Mandating that platforms provide due process before taking action against market participants;

Establishing a standard to proscribe strategic acquisitions that reduce competition;

Improvements to the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, to bring these laws into line with the challenges of the digital economy;

Eliminating anticompetitive forced arbitration clauses;

Strengthening the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice;

A simple and cheap technique to mitigate water pollution

The image is taken from the author’s photo collection

The element carbon forms only 0.025 percent of the earth’s crust by mass. But its particular valency number of 4 gives it a unique capability. The ability to react with a range of other elements. Carbon atom’s readiness to share four electrons to attain stability. Added to this, carbon is gifted with the ability to exist in three oxidation states. They are +2,+3, and +4. This makes it an accommodative partner for other elements to form an ‘alliance’ with. The alliance between elements forms a compound.

This unique approach of carbon has attracted a strong and everlasting partnership with hydrogen and other elements. This includes nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorous, and silicon. This prompted our scientists to start a new branch in chemistry. It is called organic chemistry.

Organic chemistry is the study of compounds that contains carbon. They are an indispensable part of the living world as they are the structural foundation of many compounds. This includes the backbones of life such as carbohydrates, proteins, and deoxyribonucleic acids.

As technology evolved, organic compounds found new applications. Fossil fuels are derivatives of organic compounds. They are being used worldwide for energy production.

Many human commodities are made of organic compounds. These include pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, and plastic. Their ubiquitous nature in the products has prompted the contamination of water sources. Some of them are harmless and gets degraded easily. Others have serious health repercussions on the health of the living world [1].

After the advent of ion-exchange membranes, scientists found ways to purify water. But, the removal of neutral species from water remained a problem [2]. Many organic compounds are neutral.

The process of reverse osmosis (RO) is the most advanced of ion-exchange technology today [2]. RO is capable of purifying even seawater which has the highest concentration of total solids among natural water sources [2]. But as organic compound concentrations in water sources increased, things became a little complicated.

RO is costly. The increasing presence of organic contaminants was found to be hazardous to the RO membranes affecting their lifetime. Organochlorines are one of the most potent of the membrane destroyers [2]. It became imperative to remove organic compounds before the process of RO.

RO process releases copious amounts of wastewater as RO concentrate. This water can be reused for domestic and industrial applications after treatment [2]. But the technology used for treatment should be cheap to make the venture sustainable and inexpensive.",https://medium.com/climate-conscious/the-sustainable-element-technology-nexus-that-has-great-potential-30e46a8234a1,Sophia Nynnat,2020-10-12 19:22:43.079000+00:00,"Technology,Sustainability,Health,Environment,Science"

2 Habits That Underrate Your Voice’s Influence,"Vocal Habit 1: Monotone

Modulation of the acoustic energy within the frequencies of the human voice that characterize music, similar to vocal prosody, will recruit and modulate the neural regulation of the middle ear muscles [auditory ossicles], functionally calm the behavioral and physiological state by increasing vagal regulation of the heart and promote more spontaneous social engagement behaviors…basically we start to look and feel better when we listen to melodies. (Porges, S. 2011)

It’s why a monotoned voice puts us to sleep and our ability to absorb, and perhaps retain, that information is comprised due to the shallow fundamental frequencies underlying a dull quality of voice.

As children, we can cry and speak infinitely, with nigh a break or touch of fatigue. We explore all manners of sounds, find delight in their whimsical impermanence, and wail on sirens that take our voice to the bottom of its range and swing it to its highest peaks. The colour, or prosody, of a child’s voice, is a remarkable symphony. Along the line, the range of the voice gets narrower. An exciting speaker that innervates the inner ear muscles of the audience swoops and swirls his voice through the frequencies available to him, like a painting dancing with colour. So what restricts the colour of our voice?

Firstly, in order to create prosody in the voice, your voice requires great finesse in the muscles controlling the vocal tract. Many of these vocal muscles required for prosody are innervated by the myelinated vagus nerve, and this nerve only fires efficiently when you are in a relaxed state. The reason behind this is that this nerve is governed under one of the autonomic nervous systems, the parasympathetic nervous system: the system responsible for regeneration and lowering the heart rate. When you are stressed, the sympathetic nervous system is dominant, and nerve efferents like the myelinated vagus nerve become less prominent and must battle to exert its influence over these vocal muscles.

Its why, when nervous, we find it difficult to speak, or even to speak at all!

If a person finds themselves in a constant state of stress or tension like anxiety, your body begins to learn to use your voice in a different way through repetition. Bodily and neural resources are no longer required for empathetic human speech but rather the priming of muscles for movement or, its nemesis, freezing. Speech is stripped to its bare minimum, and prosody, an element required for social cohesion, is effectively switched off. The body does the opposite required for cohesion; it either wants to fight, freeze or run away, so newer neocortex activities like speaking with prosody, or active listening by triggering the tightening of the middle ear bones, are not required. If the anxiety persists, and the vocal folds remain unstretched, the mind-body learns to acquire this new muscle memory, and the range of the voice in normal conversation can remain lacking. Because the voice is key to expressing emotions we veer into the field of psychoneuroimmunology.

Psychoneuroimmunology can be defined as the study of interactions between behavior, neural and endocrine function, and immune processes (Ader et al, 1995)

This is why understanding your emotional life is imperative to improving your voice. If you don’t get aware of your shit it may prove difficult to become aware of how your voice changes and adapts to situations you may find yourself in, especially stressful ones, if you don’t know what is triggering you to find it stressful in the first place.

Get aware of your shit.

Voice work is not easy, there is no quick fix, and you will have to develop a strong discipline to post-pone gratification; but like anything in life, anything worth doing is difficult. So, a monotoned voice can have its root in your emotional life; but it may also be maintained by poor breathing or posture. If you underpower your voice, the vocal folds have to maintain a thickness that limits the range of your frequencies at your disposal. It’s why a monotoned voice is typically quite deep. An underpowered voice means there is a lack of breath to support the voice, you may get the words out phonetically, but the ideas and emotional life of what you are saying, which live in the variances of the range of the voice, are non-existent.

Firstly, to reintroduce the potential for dynamic range in your voice focus your attention on the vowels in the word. Each vowel is a formant with a different set of frequencies in the voice; this means there is naturally occurring modulation in the vowels you speak. Over enunciating the vowels as a practice in your free time, such as reading from a book out loud, can help you get a sense of their potential in your common tongue. You’ll find that the sensation lingers having completed the exercise.

Secondly, singing is a must if your voice lacks dynamism. There is a colossal amount of research on the benefits of singing on your physical health, such as governing the release of a newly discovered chemical called endocannabinoids, which does exactly what you think it does, but it also helps stretch your vocal folds and activate articulators that may have become dormant. It forces you to kickstart your respiratory muscles to function cohesively with voicing, meaning, you learn how to give enough air to your voice so the tone and quality are not underpowered. But it needs to be practiced so might I suggest the shower! This leads us to our next rule.

Vocal Habit 2: Underpowering

This is exactly how it sounds; a self-defeating habit that really sucks as it pulls your legs out from under you! This commonly occurs when you have something important to say, and that’s the crux; because it’s important, it carries more weight, and if you don’t step up to bear it upon your shoulders, the words can implode before the idea has even left your mouth. It takes courage to speak your worth because once it's passed your lips, you cannot take it back; however, underpowering tries to do just that, “one foot out of the door and one foot in”.

You have to commit whole heartedly. There’s no sitting on the fence when you are required to speak on matters that are important to you!

Underpowering means that not enough breath is being capitalised to give enough tone, amplitude, and resonant quality to the voice so that it can either sound muffled, monotone, non-audible, or thin (lacking in harmonics that capture the inner-ear to regulate neural functions that engage social cohesion). Here are two ways it can happen: the first is that the tongue slightly stiffens up and retracts back into the throat, physically stemming the tide of sound from escaping, or “swallowing your words” as it is known. It may sound like lunacy that you’re trying to do one thing but your body is doing another but this is the role, or a specimen, of cognitive dissonance. Another key example of underpowering is when your voice fails to make it to the end of your sentence. If you consistently fall off the end of your sentence, where coincidentally the crux of the idea lives, this should concern you as it detracts from the power of your idea.

The second is a locking of the respiratory muscles. We do this when anxious to protect the body. Without going into the phylogenetic heritage of our nervous system, which you can do here, our response to stress developed to protect us from predators, so the tensing or priming of muscles was key to our survival. The most common is the constricting of the core muscles (rectus abdominis, transversus abominis, etc). A locked belly, however, does not allow for thoracic capacity to increase to efficiently intake enough air for what you may want to say, due to your core muscles being an integral part of sustaining phonation. Energy, that should be directed to controlling airflow, is instead directed to protecting the body from an ancient enemy.

Understanding how your body reacts to stress is integral to transforming the ancient neural vestiges we maintain, such as the fight-flight response to stress, into something that you can use to your adavantage.

The key is in the concept of “no effort”. Restricting primary muscles, especially those used for respiration, has an enormous impact on the use of your voice because you tend to recruit secondary respiratory muscles to pick up the slack. These muscles, such as the sternocleidomastoid, are not meant for the fine control of vocalisation and can introduce tension within the vocal tract due to their proximity. To read more about the effects of breathing on the voice may I suggest you begin with, What Crocodiles and Humans Have in Common. If you tend to find that a locked belly is common for you, you may have to begin a process of exercises that enhance your proprioception, so that you can begin to let go of excessive, and unnecessary tension, in response to stress. Relaxing and releasing specific muscles can teach you the essence of “no effort” because it teaches you to understand, via proprioception, what muscles are required, and muscles that aren’t. Like learning the guitar, where every muscle is involved, you have to learn to use only what is necessary and if it means learning how to breathe effectively again, like an infant, then so be it, there is no shame in learning.

Your body is trying to protect you from the tiger lurking behind the reeds, be patient.

What Happens Now

Practice. Record yourself and listen to yourself free of negative judgment but with honest critique and appraisal. If you find your voice lacks pitch and resonating variance, trying incorporating your body into the language. Jumping up or down, sitting and standing up, or running on the spot, will help to ignite, or rather, give you the gift of realizing your potential for colour within your voice. Become aware of the vowels within your speech, and try singing; you’ve nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Get aware of your shit. You must take responsibility for how your body deals with stress, not just for the sake of your voice but for your own self-understanding. Because it is such a primal and visceral biological function it is paramount to understand what patterns you’ve developed to cope with it and with that knowledge you may begin to unpack the myriad of ways that it affects your voice. How Stress Affects Your Voice, is another good starting point for those seeking more information.

Food Cravings: Microscopic Puppetmasters Might Be Involved,"Food Cravings: Microscopic Puppetmasters Might Be Involved

5 arguments that gut microbes can manipulate food choices.

Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay

Resisting food cravings can be a nightmare for some and a struggle for many. While the cause of food cravings itself is multifaceted — encompassing environmental, cultural, social, psychological, genetic, and behavioural (habits) factors — scientists have pondered on the microbial aspects as well.

Given that the gut-brain axis is well established in modern biology, it’s quite imaginable for gut microbes to induce cravings in the brain. As Professor Carlo Maley, director of the Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center and the first president of the International Society for Evolution, Ecology and Cancer, wrote as a senior co-author in BioAssays:

“Gut microbes may manipulate host eating behaviour in ways that promote their fitness at the expense of host fitness.”

This idea first stems from a classic example that a microbe can directly manipulate host behaviour. The parasite Toxoplasma gondii enters the rodent’s brain, making it lost its sense of fear for cat’s urine. Instead, infected rodents became attracted to cat’s urine — “a propensity that promotes the transmission of T. gondii at the expense of the fitness of the rat,” they said.

The same may apply to food cravings — that those gut microbes somehow convince the host at the subconscious level to prefer foods that contain specific nutrients that favour their growth. Gut microbes that love chocolates or sweets, for example, might motivate the host to eat them more often.

“Like microscopic puppetmasters, microbes may control the eating behavior of hosts…,” they reckoned.

To support their scientific viewpoint, Professor Maley and colleagues articulated 5 compelling evidence.

1. Taste Receptors

Germ-free mice are bred in a sterile environment and, hence, they lack proper gut microbiota. Germ-free mice are one of the best research tools to understand the impact of gut microbiota on the host physiology.

Studies have shown that germ-mice have an increased preference for fatty and sugary foods than normal mice with gut microbiota. And the germ-free mice have higher expression of receptors for fat and sugar in their mouth and intestines. This suggests that low gut microbial diversity, as reflected in germ-free mice, encourages food preferences for fats and sugars.

2. The Vagal Tone

In 2008, researchers at Mayo Clinic, Minnesota have successfully applied vagal blockage (vBloc) therapy to treat obesity. Participants consumed 30% fewer calories as a result of quicker satiation and reduced hunger.

The similar weight loss outcomes were replicated in 2016 and in 2017, with the latter study concluding that “vBloc therapy continues to result in medically meaningful weight loss with a favourable safety profile through 2 years.”The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has, in fact, already approved vBloc therapy for treating obesity in 2015.

The vagus nerve is the main driver of the body’s rest-and-digest activities. It makes sense that an overactive vagus nerve would lead to excessive digestive activities and resulting hunger. Stimulating the vagus nerve with noradrenaline in mice made them desire more food despite already eating beyond the point of satiation; this did not occur if the vagus nerve was cut.

Some gut microbes such as Bacillus and Escherichia species secrete noradrenaline. “Gut microbes that produce adrenergic neurochemicals may [therefore] contribute to overeating via mechanisms involving vagal nerve activity,” Professor Maley and his team wrote.

3. Appetite-Regulating Hormones

Lower levels of satiety hormones (e.g., leptin and cholecystokinin) have been found in germ-free mice. Feeding mice with Lactobacillus probiotics, in turn, inhibited the release of hunger hormones (e.g., agouti-related protein and neuropeptide Y) in the brain.

Certain gut bacteria can synthesize peptides that bear structural similarities to human appetite-regulating peptide hormones such as ghrelin and leptin. The structure of a protein is the chief determinant of which receptor(s) it binds to and consequently what effect(s) it exerts. Thus, these microbial peptides are ‘mimics’ to host’s appetite-regulating peptide hormones, in terms of structure and function.

These microbial peptide mimics, however, are usually silenced by host enzymes — “a phenomenon that could have evolved as a mammalian counter-adaptation to microbial manipulation,” Professor Maley et al. said in a statement. But in case they were not silenced completely, “microbial manipulation” may be in effect.

4. Toxins

Under conditions of nutrients imbalances, microbial communities normally at low levels might bloom. Excessive iron bioavailability in the gut, for instance, increases the populations of pathogenic Salmonella and Candida species that can release toxins and injure the gut.

The resulting gut inflammation could induce a negative mood, leading to emotional eating, the researchers hypothesize. Otherwise, the gut bacterial toxins might also trigger the avoidance of specific foods via the activation of pain receptors present in the gut.

5. Dietary Preferences

“Prevotella grows best on carbohydrates; dietary fibre provides a competitive advantage to Bifidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes has a substrate preference for certain fats,” Professor Maley et al. explained. Whereas Roseburia species thrive with polysaccharides or complex carbohydrates. Japanese natives have evolved a gut bacterium called Bacteroides plebeius that digests seaweed.

These show that gut microbes have food preferences too. It won’t be a surprise if they have evolved mechanisms to improve their fitness (i.e., growth) by influencing the host dietary choices, for example.

“Modern biology suggests that our bodies are composed of a diversity of organisms competing for nutritional resources,” the researchers wrote. Evolutionary competition between the host vs. gut microbes fitness may lead to “cognitive conflict” in food choices — i.e., food cravings.

“Exerting self-control over eating choices may be partly a matter of suppressing microbial signals that originate in the gut,” Professor Maley and colleagues conclude. “Acquired tastes may [therefore] be due to the acquisition of microbes that benefit from those foods.”",https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/food-cravings-microscopic-puppetmasters-might-be-involved-cb82c67d50c1,Shin Jie Yong,2020-03-27 13:06:05.353000+00:00,"Mental Health,Food,Health,Psychology,Science"

Author’s note: resting for a moment in a dark corner of the Society for Neuroscience conference’s poster hall, on the quiet solitude of the Wednesday afternoon in the History of Neuroscience aisle, a shambling figure, bent with age, appeared with a speed that belied his years. Suddenly lunging for me, he shoved a sheaf of papers into my hand, hissing in my ear “it gets worse — so much worse”. Startled, I glanced at the front page, and the date written at the top: 6th October 2106. “What is...” I began, but he’d already whirled away — “A warning!” he spat back over his shoulder. Then he stopped, growled “I hate this bit”, squeezed his conference badge — and vanished.

What follows is the text I have been able to reconstruct from those crumpled, torn, faded pages.

We’re writers, not comedians — dealing with critics is difficult

That was the infamous response comedian and poet: John Cooper Clarke gave when being insulted by a member of a live studio audience.

Sadly, us writers aren’t comedians. We can’t go around insulting every reader who disagrees with our work.

Our aim on this platform is to gain our readers’ trust. We want to provide knowledgeable, accurate and accessible content that is backed up by academic, factual and historic sources. And that gives our work a sense of credibility that can only be earned with hours, weeks or months of research.

But by insulting, or arguing with someone who disagrees with us, we are throwing away that trust.

This is because insults are interpreted by psychologists as a defence mechanism bought on by fear.

Someone disagreeing with your work is, in effect, questioning whether what you have spelled out is even accurate. And by insulting them, rather than pointing out their mistake — you are behaving as if you have something to hide. It’s like you know your content is inaccurate and you’re trying to deceive your audience.

Of course, after hours of research, you don’t want to give off that impression. But you can’t just leave that negative comment unanswered, can you? If you do, readers who see a challenge to your work may also wonder about its truth.

So how exactly should you deal with hecklers? Your response need not tip-toe around in the hopes of not offending your challenger. But it should be presented in such a way that re-establishes your credibility.

How Antibiotics Could Alter the Child’s Mind and Body Development,"How Antibiotics Could Alter the Child’s Mind and Body Development

The lesser-known health risks of antibiotics in children.

Image by rawpixel.com

Although antibiotics use has decreased overall since the early 2000s, it is not the case for respiratory diseases. In the US, it is estimated that antibiotics were prescribed to one-fifth of children’s medical visits, of which 50% were broad-spectrum (usually macrolide), and over 70% were for respiratory diseases.

Antibiotics only kill bacteria, not viruses. Yet both bacteria and viruses can cause respiratory illness. So, about 29% of antibiotics given for respiratory disease in children are unnecessary, which comprises over 10 million visits per year in the US. “Broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing in ambulatory paediatrics is extremely common and frequently inappropriate,” said a 2011 national study in the US. In 2016, the CDC reports that one in three antibiotics were given needlessly.

Unnecessary antibiotics are not only improper in the context of superbugs pandemics but come with health risks as well, especially in children. The gut microbiota is undergoing rapid changes in infancy and childhood. Antibiotics, especially broad-spectrum ones, tend to wipe out beneficial gut microbes. Not to mention that children’s brain and physique are also experiencing sensitive growth phases.

Antibiotics and Weight Gain

In a 2019 study of 586 children, 33.79% received 1–2 courses, and 5.63% received >3 courses of antibiotics within the first year of life. When these children turned six years old, those that took antibiotics had a dose-dependent increase in both excess weight and risk of future obesity. Results remained significant after adjusting for maternal age, BMI, race, marital status, income, education, smoking, diabetes, and breastfeeding. Statistically speaking, children that took 1–2 and >3 courses of antibiotics had a 0.17 and 0.42 increase in BMI z-score, respectively.

(The WHO classifies BMI z-score of < −2.0, > 1.0, > 2.0, and > 3.0 as wasted, at-risk-for-overweight, overweight, and obese, respectively, in children of 0–5 years old. Scientists use this BMI z-score method to standardized weight in light of the child’s increasing height.)

Weight gain is particularly prominent with broad-spectrum antibiotics like cephalosporins and macrolides. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics, in contrast, had little-to-no impact on weight gain unless taken for 5–7 courses.

In a 2015 Finland study of 12,062 children under two years old, those exposed to 2–3 and >4 courses of antibiotics had a 0.10 and 0.18 higher BMI z-score, respectively, than those never exposed. And this number is 0.23 and 0.28 — indicating overweight to near obesity — in girls and boys, respectively, under six months old that took macrolide, a common broad-spectrum antibiotic.

Other massive cohort studies in the US — in 2014 (65,480 children), 2015 (163,820 children), and 2017 (8,793 children) — all found a dose-response effect of antibiotics on weight gain. All results were also adjusted for possible confounding factors. The weight gain is particularly prominent with broad-spectrum antibiotics like cephalosporins and macrolides. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics, in contrast, had little-to-no impact on weight gain unless taken for 5–7 courses.

Boys appear to be more susceptible to weight gain from antibiotics than girls.

As the Finland study and other research have noticed, boys appear to be more susceptible to weight gain from antibiotics than girls.

A Canadian study in 2014 of 616 children reported that antibiotics exposure in the first year of life presented a five-fold increased odds of being overweight at 12 years old in boys but not girls.

In another 2014 study involving 74,946 children from 18 countries, early antibiotics exposure was an independent risk factor for future weight gain in boys only.

Even in chickens and older adults, males tended to gain more weight from antibiotics exposure compared to females.

While reasons are still uncertain, scientists of the 2014 multinational study speculated that: “Our finding of the BMI-promoting effects of antibiotics being confined to boys might be explained by sex-specific differences in intestinal adaptation to early-life antibiotic exposure or to how antibiotic drugs are metabolised.”

Antibiotics and Neurodevelopment

In was first shown in a 2017 study that early life antibiotics exposure may pose unfavourable neurodevelopment consequences. In New Zealand, researchers followed 871 children from birth. They learned that those with antibiotics use within the first year of life had an elevated risk of behavioural issues and symptoms of depression and ADHD at 3.5 and 11 years of age. These did not happen in children that never took or took antibiotics after age one.

The earlier the antibiotics intake, the worse the neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Later in a 2019 study, the same research team in New Zealand sought to see if their 2017 results could be replicated with another cohort of 473 children. After adjusting for confounders, children that took antibiotics within the first two years of life had lower IQ and verbal comprehension at 11 years old. The earlier the antibiotics intake, the worse the neurodevelopmental outcomes as well. Children under six months old that took antibiotics had more problems with cognition, impulsivity, working memory, ADHD, and anxiety at 11 years old than children unexposed or exposed to antibiotics at later ages.

Lastly, a nationwide Finland study in 2019 tracked 990,098 births over time. Antibiotics exposure, especially broad-spectrum ones, within the first two years of life lead to a 12–53% increased risk of “childhood development of sleep disorders, ADHD, conduct disorder, mood and anxiety disorders, and other behavioural and emotional disorders,” the academics concluded. “Given the high occurrence of early-life antibiotic exposure, and the substantial prevalence of childhood- and adolescent-onset psychopathology, modest associations among these phenomena are of public health relevance.”

Infant gut microbiota disturbance might underlie the detrimental effects of antibiotics on neurodevelopment.

While these studies did not analyse the gut microbiota, they posited that infant gut microbiota disturbance might underlie the detrimental effects of antibiotics on neurodevelopment. One research in 2018 has shown, for the first time, that infant gut microbiota profile was associated with future cognitive outcomes in children.

More robust evidence of causation can be derived from animal experimentations. Studies in 2016 and 2020 by two independent research groups presented strikingly similar results: Antibiotics disrupted the gut microbiota and memory of mice, which was followed by abnormalities in brain biochemistry related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and socioemotional neuropeptide systems.

Short Abstract

One in three antibiotic prescriptions (including in children) is not justified. Not only they hasten superbugs pandemics but pose health consequences too. Antibiotics exposure in early life (1–2 years old) is an independent risk factor for future weight gain and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, probably as a result of gut microbiota disruption. These effects are stronger with broad-spectrum antibiotics. And boys appeared to be more susceptible than girls to antibiotics-induced weight gain. So, it is best to avoid antibiotics when it is not mandatory. Lastly, an article in JAMA Pediatrics by Professor Megan Moreno, MD, is useful in helping a parent decide “When Your Child Does Not Need Antibiotics.”

2019: a lightly bamboozled review of the year in neuroscience,"1. “What’s so special about being human?”

Yes, it’s Jose Mourinho. If I had to explain, it wouldn’t be funny.

What’s so special about the human brain? A question broad and deep, one that has obsessed thinkers since Antiquity. Our once god-like status, apart and above from all animals, now steadily eroded by science, from natural selection placing us as but one species evolved from and in parallel to many others, to genetics putting the boot in by showing that we share 90 percent of our DNA with cats. Including my cat Bob, and he constantly falls off the back of the sofa.

You’d have thought neuroscience would have been all over the question of what’s special about the human brain, what with it being the study of the brain and all. But what we could do has been very limited. Largely we have only been able to observe behaviour, stuff we can do that other species cannot: talking endlessly in complex grammars, voting for bell-ends, that sort of thing. And supplement these observations with crude measures of the brain’s structure — how many neurons it has, which bits are thicker or larger than others, which bits are folded — compare them to other species, and going “ooo look it’s different”.

But to understand why the human brain is “special” we need some kind of theory as to why any of those crude brain differences would make any contribution to that specialness. For a start, to know what’s different about the neurons themselves: what’s different about the types of neurons that exist, or the signals they send, or both. Which is the preserve of us “systems” neuroscientists. Yet systems neuroscience hasn’t had much to say about this question, because of the deep problems of measuring neurons in humans. Until, that is, this year.

A. Special codes

In a brave paper, Pryluk and colleagues attempted a direct comparison of how the code used by neurons differed between humans and monkeys. They took long recordings of single neurons from the amygdala and cingulate cortex of monkeys. And compared them to similar recordings from the same regions in humans. These human recordings are ultra-rare: they came from patients with epilepsy that was both so serious and so unresponsive to drugs that they were being prepped for surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures — and to find that part, they had electrodes implanted for a week or more. And while these electrodes were in there, and while laying in their hospital bed, the patients graciously agreed to do a series of tasks for the experimenters.

With these precious data to hand, Pryluk and friends asked a straightforward question: how much information are these neurons sending? In practice, this was a tough question to ask, as there are all sorts of things to compensate for, like correcting for differing firing rates across neurons and between species. But if we believe their measurement of how much information a neuron sends, their end result is clear. Human neurons in both the amygdala and cingulate cortex send more information — in that they are closer to the maximum possible rate of information sending — and do so more efficiently : they send fewer spikes for the same amount of information. Which means? Who knows. But their results point to human cortex having an increased capacity, so that much more information can be represented across a population of neurons, but at the cost of less robust coding — if fewer spikes are used, so the message being transmitted is more sensitive to failure and noise. And as know, the human brain is very sensitive to failure.

B. Special neurons?

While the Pryluk paper hinted at something special about how the human cortex encodes information, it didn’t tell us anything about whether this is because the types of neurons are special to humans. We get much of our deep understanding of types of neurons from mice, thanks to their being the workhorse of genetics (a good thing that the actual workhorse is not the workhorse of genetics, otherwise Janelia Farm would be, literally, a farm. And about 10000 square miles in size). Hence “what’s so special about the human brain?” translates in genetics to: how do we differ from mice?

A Nature paper from the Allen Brain Institute tackled this question head-on by directly comparing the gene expression between the cortex of the human and mouse. To do that, they first had to solve the small problem of accurately sequencing the RNA-expression of single neurons in the human cortex. Having cracked that, they then grouped all their neurons into types according to the similarity of their expressed genes. The result? 69 different types of neurons in the human cortex, of which 24 are excitatory (as in, they expressed glutamate) and 45 are inhibitory.

So which of these 69 types of neuron are unique, are responsible for endowing we humans with our special brain thinking stuff? None. All 69 are also closely matched in the mouse cortex. The major difference is not the type of neuron, but where they are found. In mice, all 24 types of excitatory cell stick to one particular layer of the cortex. In humans, many of those same excitatory types appear in more than one layer of the cortex. And why would this make the human cortex special? Who knows.

Yet their results are strong confirmation of what we all know: evolution is a tinkerer. We may have diverged from rodents about 90 million years ago, but in something as complex as the mammalian brain, in which genes define merely an outline of the details of the adult brain, big changes will almost always be catastrophic. So the main difference between the neurons in the mouse and human cortex is not in the proliferation of brand new types of neurons, but in the repurposing of what is already to hand. Oh, and the fact that mice have about 10 millions neurons in their cortex, and we have about 17 billion.

C. Dendrites predict intelligence?

We like to think humans are the most intelligent species on the planet, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. A provocative paper at the very end of 2018 asked what it is about our neurons that makes us intelligent. And the answer is: the more complex the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in our cortex, the higher our IQ. Wow!

Well, maybe. Such unusual claims deserve close scrutiny. After all, extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. As we have no theory which predicts that more complex dendrites have anything to do with intelligence, so we need some pretty compelling evidence to believe this is not just happenstance correlation. The researchers obtained another rare sample of human cortical neurons: in this case, from bits of the temporal lobe removed during brain surgery, placed on ice, then popped into the experimental set-up as soon as practically possible while the neurons still lived. They took a range of measurements from the neurons. Each patient took an IQ test. And the researchers correlated some of the measurements with the IQ scores. Why these measurements? No reasons given — so already alarm bells are sounding about what other measurements were correlated with IQ, found to be lacking, and omitted from the paper.

Is the evidence compelling? No. The key evidence is the correlation between the total length of the dendrites and the IQ of the patient. Namely, this figure:

From Goriounova et al (2018). Each symbol is the average over the neurons in one subject; error bars are one standard deviation. The correlation (r value), regression (black line), and confidence interval of regression (blue shading) all appear to be taken from the symbols — i.e. the average scores.

Leaving aside the fact that this is the best correlation they have, and it is still weak (explaining 26% of the variance), take a closer look. Each data-point is a patient, so the value for the length of the dendrites is an average over the measured neurons in that patient. Now you don’t have to be a neuroanatomy geek to know that pyramidal neurons come in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes, so averaging over them is a bit…. Well, charitably we’d call it weird. More bluntly, meaningless. And I’ve just told you that human cortex contains about 24 types of excitatory neuron, and most of those are some kind of pyramidal neuron. This correlation contains just 72 pyramidal neurons in total. So it hideously undersamples the diversity of pyramidal neuron dendrites in human cortex.

Worse, the above figure and others in the paper are textbook examples of how not to compute a correlation. The correlations are computed using averages — without taking into account how wrong those averages might be. And they could be so wrong that the correlation disappears completely. Indeed, looking at the range of data variation (the error bars) in the above figure, I’d wager the correlation would indeed disappear if tested properly (more on this in the Appendix below).

Finally, a simple thought experiment. These neurons happen to come from the temporal lobe of the cortex, a region plausibly involved in some kind of “thinking” that might contribute to an IQ score. But that was just because these patients had epilepsy, and the temporal lobe usually contains the region that starts epileptic brain activity. But what if these samples had been from primary visual cortex (V1)? They’d find the same diversity of sizes of pyramidal neuron dendrites, because types of pyramidal neuron are largely consistent across the cortex. But if they’d reported a correlation between the size of dendrites in V1 and a person’s IQ score, who would have taken them seriously?",https://medium.com/the-spike/2019-a-lightly-bamboozled-review-of-the-year-in-neuroscience-5466e7525f1a,Mark Humphries,2020-01-19 11:07:05.362000+00:00,"Neuroscience,Science,Psychology,Artificial Intelligence"
Your Thoughts Are Not Original,"Whenever I have a self-proclaimed epiphany about what topic to write about next, it’s usually short-lived.

More often than not, I will encounter articles that cover similar, if not the exact, same topic or spread the same message. To make matters worse, the pieces are far more eloquently written and contain much better examples and quotes.

As an aspiring writer, it’s a little disheartening and demotivating. After all, writing interesting articles is a competitive landscape as it is. Why would a reader choose your piece over a much more accomplished author?

This thought process is a battle against yourself more than anything else. And the more time you spend fussing about it, the higher the likelihood you will find a reason not to publish or bail on an idea.

To stop doubting the value or quality of your piece, it’s worth exploring where this feeling originates. I’ve come across a few concepts that explain the psychological process that could cause this doubt, namely the Frequency Illusion and Collective Consciousness.

Frequency Illusion

As the premise of this article suggests, this concept has already been studied at length and has been coined the Frequency Illusion by Stanford linguistics professor Arnold Zwicky and is more commonly known as the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon.

The Frequency Illusion is a result of two well-known psychological processes, selective attention (noticing things that are salient to us, disregarding the rest) and confirmation bias (looking for things that support our hypotheses, disregarding potential counterevidence)

As I’m not too familiar with psychological processes, the quote above didn’t tell me that much. So I dug a little deeper into the components that comprise the frequency illusion.

Selective Attention

Attention refers to how we actively process information in our environment. It’s not only about applying focus on a specific task but also involves ignoring other information and stimuli.

Attention is a limited resource; therefore, we have to be selective about what to focus on.

This explains how we sometimes miss other things that are right in front of us. It wasn’t relevant enough at the time.

The other way around it explains how we suddenly see the same type of vehicle appear everywhere when we’ve just taken a test drive, or that more women seem to be pregnant now that you’ve been thinking about starting a family. In that sense, it highlights those events that are on top of your mind.

Confirmation bias

The second component is what is called Confirmation Bias. This concept influences how we interpret and recall information. We are more inclined to gather evidence that supports and emphasizes our beliefs and to dismiss or fail to seek contradictory evidence.

Now confirmation bias is in itself an interesting to dive into as it plays a role in a variety of highly debated topics ranging from scientific studies to politics, finance, health, religion, etc.

For the sake of this article, I will refrain from elaborating too much and revert to the scope. The point is that as you are writing about a particular topic, you will be more inclined to emphasize aspects that are aligned with the point you’re trying to make.

Collective Consciousness

Apart from the Frequency Illusion, originality is further influenced by what is called Collective Consciousness. This concept, developed by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim refers to the common set of beliefs, ideas, attitudes, and knowledge within a group or society.

Durkheim concluded that society exists because unique individuals feel a sense of solidarity with each other. The collective consciousness informs our sense of belonging, identity, and behavior.

Within a group, people are bound to come up with similar thought processes as it reaffirms their sense of belonging. That is why you will find a lot of agreeable opinions, open doors, and repetition to stay in line with the homogeneous character of the group.

So what’s the point?

If it’s all been thought out before and we’re so biased based on our attention span and our position in society, why bother stressing about originality?

Well, you probably shouldn’t. Even though an idea is far more likely to have been thought out before deriving your own opinions and conclusions from, it is a worthwhile exercise. That’s the part where you gain understanding and learn about how to apply the learnings to benefit yourself and others.

To paraphrase what the author Mark Manson wrote in his most recent book “Everything is f*cked” and that I find particularly applicable here is:

“Values cannot be changed with reason, only through experience”

Look to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to understand and uplift your readers during COVID — and beyond

Illustration by Cynthia Marinakos.

He had a dream.

A vision.

A vision of a peace table where people would sit around discussing the important things in life — human nature, hatred, war, peace, and brotherhood.

Just after Pearl Harbour, this man drove home in his car, stopped to let through a “poor, pathetic parade.” Tears ran down his face as he watched. He was overwhelmed with sadness that “we didn’t understand — not Hitler, nor the Germans, nor Stalin, nor the communists. We didn’t understand any of them.”

And this man believed this lack of understanding was holding back progress.

“It was at that moment that I realized that the rest of my life must be devoted to discovering a psychology for the peace table. That moment changed my whole life.”

This was the drive behind Abraham Maslow’s famous hierarchy of needs, as told by Hoffman in The right to be human: A biography of Abraham Maslow (1999, 2nd edition).

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs was first introduced in his 1943 paper “A Theory of Human Motivation” in Psychological Review. It has been used widely in many different fields, particularly in management, to understand human motivation and happiness.

What made Maslow’s studies different from other psychologists during his time was his focus on happiness and health — rather than human weakness. He believed when basic needs are met, the deeper desires of creativity and fulfilling our potential can be addressed.

How is this helpful when writing content — and headlines? Firstly, we can better capture our reader’s attention with content that addresses their deep needs. Secondly, when we believe our reader is capable of achieving their best self, we help our readers believe that too.

Today we’ll look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and learn how we can bond more deeply with our readers by fulfilling one or more of these needs in our content and headline writing.",https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-a-77-year-old-theory-can-help-you-write-wonderful-headlines-c5c818600132,Cynthia Marinakos,2020-05-05 16:19:44.780000+00:00,"Headline Hacks,Writing,Psychology,Creativity,Productivity"
Exploring Your Mobile App Business Idea,"An actionable post to get going with your mobile app idea

In this post, I give you actionable advice on what to think about and consider before you start building your mobile app business idea. As a web- and mobile developer with over 16 years of experience on his belt, I’ve learned what needs consideration before you start your mobile adventure, both for business supporting apps and stand-alone mobile app services.

Every assumption that you’re starting your mobile app product on is false until proven valid

Your Assumptions Are Wrong

In an era where building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), and pivoting ideas as taught by The Lean Startup and agile processes are king, assuming you just need to build your mobile app and turning it into a success is proven to have a 99% chance of failing.

Every assumption that you’re starting your mobile app product on is false until proven valid. This is a law that applies universally.

I’m not saying you’re always in the wrong ball-park. But it is unlikely that you are spot on in one stroke, and you should always assume that you are working on wrong assumptions.

Your assumptions could be a little off and just need a little tweaking to work for your idea, or they can be wrong entirely.

As an entrepreneur or maker, it is your job to find out what assumptions are right and wrong, and how to improve them or find the right ones for your product.

Here are some ways that can help you to minimize the error in your assumptions:

Scratch your itch: work on an idea for a solution that you need for yourself or to solve a problem that you’re experiencing yourself. That way, you can validate if it works for you. You’ll need to find out if there are enough of other people that have the same problem to see if this is going to be viable

Idea pivoting: create the simplest form of your idea that helps you to demonstrate your solution to others. This could be as simple as creating an Excel sheet, a clickable wireframe, mockups, or non-coding examples. If you’re a quick developer a simple duct tape proof of concept using your developer stack could do as well. Just invest the least amount of effort that is needed to enable the demonstration of your idea

Landing pages: you can pivot your idea on a simple website to show how and what value it provides (and for whom) to see if it gets tractions before you build anything.

There are awesome books available that can help to provide you with the right mindset and information to find out if your idea is viable.

Coming from a technical background, the following books helped me to shape my mindset for sure:

How To Make Your Writing More Engaging,"A few months ago, I wrote a review of award-winning editor Jack Hart’s book Storycraft: The Complete Guide to Writing Narrative Nonfiction.

(That’s my Amazon affiliate link above — I’ll make a small comission if you buy a copy at no extra cost to you. Thanks!)

Storycraft is one of my favorite books on the craft of writing (I share several of my other favorite books in my article here). Even though Hart aimed his book at writers of nonfiction, I believe there is much that writers of fiction can glean from its pages too.

In fact, there’s one chapter in particular that’s a goldmine of editing tips for any kind of writing. Recently, I collected my top takeaways from the chapter and arranged them as an editing checklist for myself when I work on blog posts, essays, and short stories.

I’ve found these tips incredibly helpful so, today, I wanted to share seven of them with you!

These powerful editing tips will help you breathe life into your writing, turn plodding sentences and paragraphs into fast-paced narratives, and capture the attention of your readers.

Let’s dive in.

1. Get Moving in Your Introduction

Hart emphasizes the importance of getting moving right out of the block. Make sure your opening paragraphs aren’t dry and filled with exposition. Instead, they should include a sentence or two that catches your reader’s interest and entices them to read more.

Hook your readers with action, curiosity, or intrigue.

The hook might be the very first sentence in your piece — a real attention grabber like the opening line of George Orwell’s 1984,

“It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”

In my recent memoir essay “Expecting the Unexpected in New York City”, I followed that approach, opening with this sentence,

“During the two-and-a-half years that I went to college in New York City, I witnessed a crime only once.”

However, you can also bury the hook several paragraphs into your piece as I did in my essay “The Hidden Treasure Beneath My Library”, and as Joan Didion did in her essay “Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream” when she writes, after three paragraphs,

“Imagine Banyan Street first, because Banyan is where it happened.”

Even if the hook appears several paragraphs into your story or essay, make sure those preceding paragraphs are fast moving. They might even hint that a twist or something else unexpected is coming.

And that leads into tip #2.

2. Push Scenes Forward with Continuous Motion

Scenes should not be stagnant. At the end of a scene, the action should move forward. The characters shouldn’t be glued to their chairs and talking to each other like robots. That will bore our readers to tears!

If you have scenes with dialogue, include descriptions of what the characters are doing while they’re talking. Often, this is more effective at revealing what they’re feeling then if you used words like “angrily.”

For example, compare these two sentences:

“I’m not talking about this,” he said angrily. “I’m not talking about this,” he said and slammed the door behind him.

When you’re editing your piece, look to see if you’ve included motion to push scenes forward. If you’re writing an informative blog post, this might mean including a story to illustrate a point.

3. Use the Language of Action

Are your action scenes as powerful as they could be?

Hart points out that the most powerful action words describe causality.

For example, let’s say you’re describing a woman driving a car. She tries to swerve out of the way of something in the road. You could write, “The car jerked to the left.”

But Hart suggests that it would be more gripping to write, “She jerked the wheel to the left”. It puts us closer to where the action is happening.

4. Write in the Active Voice

With tip #3 in mind, when you edit your piece, make sure you’ve written your sentences in the active voice and not the passive.

If your high school grammar is a little rusty, you can read a quick review of passive sentences here. Essentially, in a passive sentence, the subject receives the action rather than performing it.

For example, politicians and business executives like to use the passive voice when they want to avoid claiming responsibility for a mistake. They might write, “Mistakes were made.”

It’s a neat little trick because this sentence avoids taking responsibility by failing to tell us who made the mistakes.

Note that you can’t fix a passive sentence by tacking the subject onto the end. “Mistakes were made by all of us” is still passive.

So how to fix it?

Just write, “We all made mistakes.” Now the sentence is active.

5. Eliminate Unnecessary Words

In his book On Writing Well, William Zinsser notes,

…The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that’s already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what–these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence.

Hart agrees and recommends eliminating the following unnecessary words in order to write strong sentences:

1. Progressive tense and auxiliary verbs. Write “The wind blows” or “The wind blew” instead of “the wind is blowing” or “the wind had blown.”

2. Empty Words. For example, eliminate “There are”, “There is”, “There was”, “It is”, “It was”. I shared more about empty words in my article here.

3. Beginning of an action. For example, don’t say “He began to race around the room.” Just write, “He raced around the room.”

6. Use Time Markers and Straight Chronology

Sometimes when you’re writing a narrative, it’s necessary to skip forward or backward in time. However, if you do, be sure you use clear time markers so your readers don’t get confused.

If your reader has to stop to try to figure out when something is happening, it will definitely slow down the pace of your narrative.

A time marker just means that you write a line explaining when the next scene is going to take place. For example, “None of this would have happened if I hadn’t received that call two days earlier…” or “Fast forward three weeks later.”

Hart points out that sometimes your time markers can be more subtle,

“You might simply note the fall colors on the trees when you open a new scene that jumps ahead from summer to autumn. Or you could slip in the height of the sun in the sky when a character walks out of a building.”

He also believes straight chronology is the easiest for readers to follow, so evaluate your piece to see if a flashback really is necessary. Sometimes I’ll rearrange paragraphs in my piece because I realize that jumping backward and then forward in time might be confusing to my readers.

7. Speed up, then Slow Down

Speed up during the boring parts. Slow down during the climatic scenes.

How do you speed up? Wherever you have lots of exposition, make sure you’re only communicating what’s absolutely necessary for your readers to know.

I’ll ask myself, “Is this paragraph of description necessary? Is this back-story necessary?”

When you reach a climatic moment in your piece, however, you’ll want to slow down the pace of your writing to keep your readers in suspense. It will give the writing a breathless quality.

Hart quotes Pulitzer-Prize winner Tom French,

“The reason you slow down is so that the reader can really feel and process and really enter that scene…And how do you slow down?…You allow more space on the page. You allow more sentences. You literally write in shorter sentences. You get more paragraph breaks. You use space. You find pauses inside the scene that occur naturally that you would normally skip over.”

I wrote more about varying sentence structure in my article below:

Predicting The Protein Structures Using AI,"Proteins are found essentially in all organisms, and they are basically a sequence of amino acids that are arranged in a particular structure. For many decades, scientists have been able to accurately compute the sequence of amino acids, but however, accurately predicting the structure of the protein has always been a challenging task. If we are able to decode the sequence of the amino acids in the protein structure and accurately determine the structure of the protein, then it will serve a number of functions.

Accurate prediction of protein structure will be very helpful in understanding the biological evolution of that particular protein and it will also help us understand the kind of diseases it can cause and the kind of defense it can provide against other diseases.

Essentially, accurate prediction of the structure of the protein is the key to understand the function of proteins and cells and as well as to understand how they can malfunction and cause diseases and this understanding could also be very helpful in the development of treatment and vaccines.

Now, if you look at the SARS-CoV-2, it is the spike protein structure of the Virus that latches onto the AS2 receptor in our cells, thereby leading to the occurrence of the infection. We have been able to develop this understanding quite quickly, mainly because of the progress that we have made with regard to our understanding and prediction of protein structures.

First Discovery

See, this field began evolving many decades ago, and back in 1972, a scientist known as Christian B. Anfinsen predicted that by accurately computing the sequence of amino acids, we will be able to deduce the protein structure. So this discovery won him the Nobel Prize for chemistry and it laid the foundation for analysis and prediction of protein structures.

X-ray Crystallography

Then nearly 60 years ago a scientist known as Max Perutz started to predict protein structures by using experiments. He made use of X-ray crystallography to determine the exact structure of myoglobin and hemoglobin and it was this discovery that helped us understand the true function of hemoglobin in the blood, which is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and cells. This understanding of the structure of myoglobin and hemoglobin also helped us understand how a change in a single amino acid can cause diseases such as sickle cell anemia.

Genome Sequencing

Today, decoding the sequence of amino acids and accurately completing the sequence has become more advanced, thanks to the progress achieved in genome sequencing. Because at the end of the day, the protein structures in the amino acids are essentially a part of the genome itself and the rapid advances we have made in genome sequencing have helped us to easily compute the sequence of amino acids. But however, when it comes to creating a 3D structure of the protein, these experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, etc., can be quite ineffective and they’re also very time consuming and expensive.

India’s Contribution

When it comes to the field of protein structural work. Even India is a leading country because an Indian scientist known as GN Ramachandran developed the Ramachandran plot, which today has become the model for scientists around the world to understand the structure of proteins.

CASP Technique

Then in 1994, a scientist known as John Moult came up with the CASP technique, which stands for Critical Assessment for Protein Structure Prediction, and this is provided for a comparative model through which protein structures can be predicted.

Specialty Of AI

But however, predicting protein structures is a very complex and challenging exercise, especially when you’re relying upon traditional experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. This is where the emergence of artificial intelligence has caused a major disruption in the field of protein structure prediction. In 2018, a company known as Deep Mind made use of artificial intelligence and deep learning to come out with a predictive algorithm, which today has emerged as a breakthrough technology that can accurately predict protein structure.

Conclusion

These advances made in the production of protein structure with the usage of artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms have transformed our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 and it has definitely enabled the accelerated development of vaccines.

NEXT 2018 — Google crossing the cloud chasm?,"Last week I had a great time at NEXT in San Francisco where Google audaciously, in front of 25,000 people outlined where it is heading with Google Cloud. Below is my synthesis on the vast amount of material that was conveyed.

Only 5–10% of payloads that will end up on public cloud, have been migrated

It was highlighted a couple of times that only a fraction of possible payloads are on public cloud. My inner history nerd took note, having long been a fan of Geoffrey Moore’s seminal book, “Crossing the Chasm” and it’s technology adoption curve. It is universally acknowledged that in regards to public cloud, Amazon won the early phases. Google and others are working hard to compete, but the stat outlines the main prize is still up for grabs.

What I witnessed at NEXT, was Dianne Greene and her team’s play on how they are working to cross the chasm, to win the early majority phase. Something Dianne and many of her team achieved at VMWare and virtualisation.

Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

Google’s play on AI was threaded through the whole week. The message has evolved to be a little more tempered and nuanced. Companies who harness AI will be enhancing experiences rather than taking over the world with Daleks or drones. Conversational AI in the call centre looks imminent. Dialogflow had a phone gateway and sentiment features added. For companies willing to invest, the opportunity to have a cost effective, but yet engaging “AI enabled” triage process on the phone, or in online chat for better customer engagement outcomes can start to be achieved.

I have led a number of Cloud Vision API projects in the past 6 months. AutoML Vision will add a bump to accuracy over the generic vision models without the need for a team of data engineers and data scientists to manage a neural net pipeline. AutoML will be comparatively easy to use for those who understand stats and and can use an API.

Deploying the new mobile Edge TPU processors with TensorFlow Lite gives a path to embedding ML algorithms at remote sides with hardware acceleration to provide real time feedback. Useful for miners, manufacturing plants and the like. I expect the initial use cases to be initially deployed on stock Android devices running TensorFlow Lite without the hardware acceleration.

I participated in a Business Transformation workshop where we worked up and pitched ideas on how to expand the impact of Wildbook, which is crowd sourcing video and camera phone images to help track individual animals via their markings. This collectively enables the mapping of endangered species and their human interaction. Their solution uses a combination of GCP Cloud ML APIs and custom Tensorflow models. All open sourced and available for budding data scientists to look at.

From Data to Insights

Google’s advantage in data tooling is being pressed home. BigQuery just keeps getting better and better with announcement at NEXT in regards to Machine Learning and Geolocation. Tino Tereshko the BigQuery Product Manager, graciously provided some time with Graham Polley and myself on Friday after the conference, my takeaway — the BQ roadmap has a mix of continuous improvement and cool shiny new things. It is only going to get more powerful, more capable, while still being easy to use.

BigQuery as a Marketing Data platform also emerged through a number of marketing related sessions — a space, we at Servian are excited to be working in. GCP and BigQuery gives Marketing and Customer Experience the power to ingest and process various data sources to personalise customer journeys while being responsive to marketers needs. There were a number of use cases where leading brands in the USA were using GCP to give visibility of attribution, and provide personalisation insights to improve outcomes. At Servian, we see this becoming more common as GPDR, privacy concerns and CFOs nudge marketers towards adopting techniques aligned to enterprise data approaches. It will require these techniques to be deployed on well architected and managed cloud solutions to provide the flexibility marketers need to be effective.

The boring data privacy stuff is also being addressed. The Data Loss Prevention API can scan, redact and tokenize any sensitive data on static or streaming data.

Developing & running applications

Kelsey Hightower in his “container” on stage

For developers, Google showed off its natural engineering flair. Kelsey Hightower rocked the stage in the Keynote on Day 3. Cloud Build, KNative serverless containers, all add capabilities to the platform. They help the speed and ease of developing code and then testing, deploying plus running it. Google are also making their platform capabilities easier to leverage by development teams through open source projects such as Spring Cloud and Go-cloud.

GKE On Prem running in VSphere

All the above however does not provide a runtime bridge to on prem data centres. GKE On Prem however does. Many companies use cloud for dev/test and run production in their on prem data centres. Google have just provided an end to end way to support this hybrid pattern through its combo of Kubernetes, Istio and GKE on Prem under its unified Cloud Services Platform .

Google’s acquisition of Velostrata was also detailed. Velostrata provides tooling support for Google Cloud customers that enables VMWare or AWS migrations to GCP with minimum down time, and rollback if needed. Google bought a migration bridge to compliment the runtime bridge they built.

Security

Many enterprise security stakeholders express concerns about public cloud vendors and their PaaS style services which are typically exposed on internet facing endpoints. They want them to be secured within a VPC. Google announced their answer to this customer need with VPC Service Controls entering Beta.

Istio is addressing a need to secure service interactions but with a policy managed approach. There are a number of financial services organisations who have built this kind of service mesh or dynamic secure networking capability themselves. Istio provides an open source approach to meeting this need. Google are once again making this easy to operate with Istio part of its Cloud Services Platform, PaaS style service. I think many people are missing that Istio can be applied beyond micro-services, with the Istio Mesh Expansion. Once it matures a little more, it will be able to extend the service mesh beyond Kubernetes to secure traditional 2/3 tier applications. Thus bringing observability and policy driven security on service interactions. All of this able to be undertaken, without impacting application code — providing secure operational agility beyond what is typically achieved in many on-prem environments.

Google’s BeyondCorp model which outlines defence in depth for employee enterprise applications had a range of security capabilities outlined at NEXT including an Identity aware proxy for internal applications, geo-aware Cloud Armor DDOS protection and the Titan security key for 2 Factor Authentication.

In Summary

Diane Greene, her ex-VMWare crew plus the rest of the Googlers lifted the curtain on their capability roadmap at NEXT. With so much to take in, it is only when I have stepped back, that I appreciated the strategic vision, direction and focus. What I believe is clear, is that, as the announcements from NEXT move to be generally available over the next 12 months. Google Cloud will have a clear, coherent end to end public cloud capability.

The remaining question then will be, whether or not Google and their partners get the marketing right to cross the chasm by winning the hearts and minds of customers to buy into Google Cloud.

The has beens — beer miler, e-gamer and sprinter

From a personal viewpoint, I had a really enjoyable panel discussion on stage with Jon Fong, Jason Martin and Dhruv Parpia on running a successful cloud practice.

In regards to San Fran, it was 3 years between visits — Americans seems to be using the term ‘mobile’ now in contrast to ‘cell’, when describing their phones — not sure when that happened. Skateboarding is back. The contrast between the wealth and poverty seemed to be starker. Looking up at the multiple gleaming Salesforce office towers provided a sobering backdrop against many of the poor on the streets.

Do Headlines Really Make a Difference?,"Do Headlines Really Make a Difference?

First impressions count

Illustration by Cynthia Marinakos

It gets a little confusing.

What really gets writers noticed?

Quality writing. Formatting. Getting curated. Submitting to publications. Headlines.

Writing a lot. Writing less with quality. Getting claps. Shares. Reads. Comments. Tagging other writers. Choosing the right tags.

There are so many aspects to writing, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Add to that a crapload of well-meaning advice out there sharing the pros and cons of all of these.

What should you focus on?

Great writing, of course. That’s what people are here for. Also, focus on your headline. Here’s why:

Think of the last job you applied for — and how it compares to writing.

You’ve got the experience and skills for the job — quality.

You’ve sent your CV out to employers — submitting to publications.

Perhaps you’ve applied to 30 jobs. Perhaps only to three — writing frequency.

Sometimes you get an interview. Other times you don’t hear a damn thing — claps, shares, reads, comments.

Say you land an interview — awesome!

You prep answers and practice with a mate. Perhaps you even video yourself and record your answers. Analyzing. Refining. Practicing again and again. Rehearsing your answers to your partner. Speaking to no one but the pitter-patter of the shower. While you munch on your cornflakes. In your sleep. The lines echoing in your mind as soon as you wake.

Bring it on!

You’re feeling calm. Confident. Composed.

You walk into the interview…

Wearing your PJs. Hair unbrushed. Crusty drool around your mouth. Sleep in your eyes. Stinky breath. Slouching. Head down. Your eyes not meeting anyone’s eyes. You did put on some runners though.

What sort of first impression are you making?

Well not bothering with your headlines is a lot like that.

Heading in fully prepared yet not taking time to dress well and make a good first impression at your interview is a surefire way to throw a job away — if not get hauled out of the building by security.

Writing often. Writing tags. Submitting to publications. All that doesn’t matter if you don’t pay attention to your headline. Your readers, curators, editors — your colleagues, prospects, customers — they’ll ignore all that hard work you’ve put into your:

Article.

Report.

Presentation.

Ad.

TED talk.

Apart from being ignored, you miss out. You miss out on money from more readership and sponsors. You miss out on being respected and admired. You miss out on invitations that help you realize your dreams and ambitions.

You miss out on gifting the world with insights you know will make their work, their relationships, their writing, their health — better.

Unleash the Potential of AI in Circular Economy: Businesses Potentials,"Business Potential of AI in promoting circular Economy

1. Environmental impact analysis and monitoring

From CSR to ESG, most businesses today have good intentions to stand up to their environmental and social responsibilities. Nevertheless, in order for them to reduce its environmental impact, they need to first estimate the effect of their activities in quantitative means. Producing such estimates could be challenging, especially for large businesses involved in multiple chains of production and distribution. This can be resolved by the use of IOT ( Internet of Things) and smart sensors. IOT allows automation of accurate and reliable data collection, which could then be fed into data analytic algorithms that outputs analysis of the different sources externalities or pollutions. Businesses could gain insights from these analysis and take actions. For example, by identifying the greatest source of residuals or pollutants in a manufacturing procedure businesses could invest in developing or switching to more efficient production methods to cut their impact.

2. Big data powered product innovation

Using big data, product development can be done in a more evidence based manner. Two of the main product features that would be desirable for circular economy are modularity and durability. The benefits of greater durability is obvious by itself, on the other hand, modularity means to decompose a complex product engineering process into simple subparts. Greater modularity could then make product remanufacturing and recycling more convenient, it “permit the arrangement of components in a manner that can be easily modified, enhanced, exchanged, or proliferated.” (Tucker J. Marion, 2010) During the process of product development, data can be collected from prototyping and testing of the product. These data can now be analyzed iteratively through machine learning algorithms, which assists with the evaluation of these desirable sustainable product features and could be used to improve upon current design of products

3. Blockchain and cryptographic anchoring for supply chain management

Another challenge in tracking and recognizing environmental impact of businesses is the difficulties in reliably following and trace back to the source of its inputs. What blockchain could do is to make the whole supply chain “transparent”, where each stage in the chain is recorded in an immutable way. Imagine you operate a small restaurant, to provide tasty dishes to customers, you would need to purchase the ingredients. To make it simpler, let’s only focus on the meat supplier. In order to know whether the meat supplier is operating in an ethical and sustainable production process, you need to know which livestock farm did they get their “inputs” from. If you would like to dig deeper, you might also want to know the source of the food they fed to the livestock. This could quickly get complex and difficult to track, and that is indeed a general concern of many businesses, especially for those that have to manage a large variety of suppliers, such as Walmart. Indeed, Walmart was one of the earliest adopters to test the application of supply chain management using blockchain by using it to trace pork in China, to authenticate transactions and facilitate accurate and efficient record keeping.

4. Smart inventory management

Smart inventory management mainly concerns with the accurate prediction of customer demand to efficiently produce the right amount of product at the right time. Stockpiling could be extremely wasteful and costly for a business, especially in cases where the product cannot be stored for a long period of time, either because of the nature of the product (fresh food), or because of the decrease in value of product over time (fashion products). By using internal data such as records of past sales, customer preferences and external data such as competitor’s performances, market demand fluctuations and patterns, AI’s prediction capabilities can be utilized to prevent stockpiling and excess inventories. This not only reduces the inventory rental cost for companies, but also greatly lowered the amount of waste and unused products that may impede for transition to a circular economy. There are already wide use of smart inventory management using Internet of things and machine learning, an example of such service provider is “Zenventory”.

5. Automated Optimizing Delivery and Shipping

The use of AI have enabled us to improve the logistics of shipping and delivery by designing the fastest route. On one hand it could analyze customer order data to make best plan for shipping in different regions, on the other hand real-time traffic data can be used to produce efficient scheduling of deliveries. Moreover, the scope of AI usage in delivery extends beyond backend planning to autonomous shipping. In 2018, Rolls Royce and Finferries launched the first fully autonomous car ferry. The cost advantages of using autonomous truck in B2C (business to customer) last mile delivery is substantial, with potential of reducing delivery costs by 10% comparing to traditional delivery method ( McKinsey,2018). The design of the fastest route reduced the amount of pollutants created by shipping vehicles , especially for oversea shipping, while autonomous delivery act as a solution to effective, low manual input delivery, allowing more funds and human resources to be devoted to more productive usage.",https://medium.com/swlh/unleash-the-potential-of-ai-in-circular-economy-businesses-potentials-ff3056098699,Americana Chen,2020-12-07 22:46:53.490000+00:00,"Economics,Big Data,Sustainability,AI,Artificial Intelligence"

“Just write every day” is not the answer

The writer’s job is not to write. It is to think and to make others think.

This is a hard job today. It isn’t because people are getting dumber (although it seems that way at times). It’s because we, your potential readers, are drowning in content.

The bar for getting and keeping a person’s attention in order to make them think is higher than a giraffe’s ear hair.

In 2012, Seth Godin said: “We’re living in the first moment in time… when credentials, access to capital, and raw power have been dwarfed by the simple question: do I care about what you do?”

That’s never been more true.

The problem? Good writing doesn’t get anyone’s attention.

Novelty does.

The right adjective is not nearly as important as the right story. What has your reader not seen? Or at least, what have they not seen lately? A good writer finds what’s missing. They look where nobody else is looking.

This, too, is a difficult job to execute.

Luckily, though, the answers are simple:",https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-to-write-something-people-will-actually-read-9749026ab6bc,Todd Brison,2020-08-11 18:03:49.857000+00:00,"Work,Entrepreneurship,Writing,Creativity,Productivity"
What It’s Like to Have an ADHD Brain,"What It’s Like to Have an ADHD Brain

And how I found refuge from the nonstop chaos inside my own head

I’ve always sought comfort in familiar things. I rewatch the same TV shows. I reread the same books. I listen to the same songs for months on end. My routine isn’t about scheduling — it’s about having a shortlist of familiar activities. It feels as if I’m trying to escape my own spinning brain.

No two people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) present the exact same way, but there are commonalities. The vast majority of adults with ADHD, for instance, aren’t hyperactive on the outside, but on the inside.

The moment my head touches a pillow, my brain starts doing somersaults. Intrusive thoughts rear their ugly heads. Remember when you made that girl cry in the sixth grade because you wouldn’t stop poking her? Remember when you said “shit happens” in that job interview? Oh, remember that time you drank too much champagne on a date and ran crying out of The Hunger Games?

Most often, though, it’s half-baked big ideas that turn my mind into a clown car. Ideas for work. Ideas for a new book. Ideas for the nursery for a baby who doesn’t exist yet. The world is full of endless possibilities to contemplate, and my brain has no idea where to put them all. They just tumble around in there like balls in a lottery machine.

In the ADHD brain, the team is short-staffed.

Tuning things out is another formidable task. William Dodson, MD, an adult ADHD specialist in Denver, Colorado, writes in ADDitude that many people with ADHD have amplified senses, making it hard for us to block out stimulation. I hate shirt tags. I don’t like being touched unexpectedly. Loud music in the morning stresses me out. I turn my phone upside down on my nightstand so I can’t see the gently pulsing light as it charges. Ambient noise is my escape from nocturnal household sounds — ticking clocks are torture, and I live in fear of night-owl neighbors with booming baritone voices. Even in winter, I would sleep with an oscillating fan facing the wall until my husband bought me a white-noise machine.

I’ve developed good habits. I take medication. I make to-do lists every morning. My desk is plastered in sticky notes. I don’t play music while I work — I’ll just end up listening to it — but my trusty fan helps muffle the sound of my brain arguing with itself. I keep pages upon pages of overlapping projects. It’s not uncommon for individuals with ADHD to have trouble visualizing an entire task from start to finish. I pick up one thread, follow it for a bit, grab several more along the way, and before I know it, I’m holding a tangled ball of yarn. As I’ve grown older, I’ve developed the patience to occasionally pull a thread free.

Before I learned how to manage my time, deadlines would appear out of nowhere, and at the 11th hour I would find the motivation to churn out a final product in record time. I’ve often felt like the hare keeping up with the tortoise — aimless wandering punctuated by frantic spurts of focused energy.

I’ve learned to channel a common but counterintuitive feature of ADHD called hyperfocus. I sit down to work at 8:30 a.m., and suddenly it’s 3:45 p.m. Normally this only happens to people with ADHD when they’re doing something they enjoy, so it’s a good sign that I like my job. Of course, it also means that my house looks like it was hit by a tornado and I often forget to eat lunch.

When I do get out of “the zone,” all of my unfocused thoughts clamor for attention. The brain’s reward pathway has a built-in executive team in the corpus striatum, which helps filter the constant influx of thoughts and emotions and file them in their proper places. Some items should be addressed right away, some can wait, and many go straight to the trash. Occasionally, the team sends the single most important item on the agenda up to the prefrontal cortex for attention.

In the ADHD brain, the team is short-staffed. Everything — including the trash — goes into one big pile of equal importance. Dodson writes that stimulants work by providing support to the team — helping the striatum choose the single most important task, rather than half a dozen at once.

Yet there’s one thing ADHD brains are really good at: recognizing things they want to do and things they don’t.

Motivation is a chemical reaction. Ellen Littman, PhD, a clinical psychologist in New York, writes that the ADHD brain’s reward pathway is off-balance; it takes a lot more dopamine to make us feel happy or satisfied. Reward deficiency syndrome (RDS), a term coined by Kenneth Blum, PhD, makes it extremely difficult to muster the willpower to perform mundane tasks — even important ones — if they don’t pack a big enough dopamine punch. Novelty-seeking behavior is common. Some people with ADHD might become firefighters, drive recklessly, or abuse substances in their search for a boost. RDS is linked to procrastination and addiction, both common features of ADHD. Some might call it a lack of willpower. They’d be right, in a way, but it comes down to brain chemistry — not laziness.

Put simply, we’re the donkey, and dopamine is the carrot. The only carrot.

Yet not every ADHD brain is an adrenaline junkie. Littman writes that individuals with more hypersensitive ADHD may be living in a constant state of sensory overload. With so much stimulation and no way to compartmentalize it, these people might avoid crowds or loud venues. Many seek refuge in video games, where they experience dopamine boosts but have control over the amount of sensory input.

The world is full of endless possibilities to contemplate, and my brain has no idea where to put them all.

I seem to have feet in both camps. I’ll gladly jump off a cliff, perform CPR, ride roller coasters, visit new places, or drive a four-wheeler down a highway. But when the time comes to regain control over the level of stimulation, I extract myself and seek refuge in familiar, comfortable activities. Novel experiences during this time — Watch this YouTube video! Try ordering something fun for dinner! Take a different route home! — become less friendly, adding to a feeling of bombardment and stress. To escape the chaos and get my dopamine boost, I watch Lord of the Rings over and over again while I play Candy Crush. I work out to the same playlist of 20 songs. I play familiar piano pieces. I read Harry Potter for the dozenth time.

The psychology of ADHD makes sense of these behaviors. “People with ADD find various ways of self-soothing. It can [help] to have a routine and repeat it over and over again,” says psychiatrist Ned Hallowell, MD, founder of the Hallowell Centers and author of Driven to Distraction. “They look to alter their inner state. I call that the ‘itch’ at the core of ADHD. Some of the most adaptive ways to scratch that itch are having a creative outlet, physical exercise, or close relationships. The maladaptive ways are compulsive activities, gambling, substance abuse, surfing the net, video games, those kinds of things.”

Sandy Newmark, MD, founder of the Center for Pediatric Integrative Medicine and author of ADHD Without Drugs: A Guide to the Natural Care of Children with ADHD, agrees. “A lot of kids with ADHD also have a sensory processing disorder…If they have the kind where they’re over-sensitive [or inattentive], that might be a reason to seek familiar activities…I can see how it would be soothing.” In my case, this behavior has carried itself into my adult life, which is not uncommon in ADHD.

The important thing to remember is that for people with ADHD in particular, every escape is also an entrance.

“You’re leaving one place, but you’re entering another,” Hallowell says. “When you’re watching TV, you’re entering into the world of the TV show. When you’re going on a ride at an amusement park, you’re escaping into the thrill of the ride. When you’re escaping into…a drug, you’re entering into the world that drug creates for you. You’re never escaping into nothing.”

Despite the chaos, people with ADHD excel at the things we enjoy. We have a remarkable ability to channel our energy into creative pursuits — writing, journalism, music, design, teaching, freelance work. We are constantly tempted to escape the mundane and chase what makes us happy. With healthy habits, support, and good communication, this can lead us to incredibly fulfilling lives.

I like to imagine a world where more people chased what made them happy, instead of what they think they’re supposed to do. In that, I think we ADHD brains have it all figured out.",https://elemental.medium.com/what-its-like-to-have-an-adhd-brain-52a7c5171d8f,Natalie Slivinski,2019-09-27 18:16:52.358000+00:00,"Mental Health,Brain,Psychology,Great Escape,Science"
Four Reasons You Won’t Make It as a Professional Writer,"You complain.

You are complaining that other writers have it easier than you.

Yes. Some writers will just take off. Like my previous example of writer Allie Brosh. Good for them. Be happy for them, even if the only reason you are happy for them is that complaining will not be good for your writing career.

There is a lot of negativity online. Don’t add to it. People aren’t attracted to people who complain and approach anything with a “whoa is me” attitude.

We all have pangs of envy and jealousy.

I read an article in The Atlantic last night that had me really questioning if I’d ever be a great writer; that doesn’t really matter; the only thing that matters is if I like to write and whether I think it is worth time. I do.

If you wonder why some writers take-off faster than you, you are putting your energy in the wrong place. You may think, I can’t believe so and so wrote that piece, and it has X amount of views; it isn’t even very good. I can write a better piece than that four minute piece of…

Well, you didn’t write that four-minute piece of …that everyone seems to love. You didn’t come up with the idea or articulate it in a way that resonates.

Instead of concentrating on why you think they don’t deserve x and x, put that energy into writing better.

Do this instead.

One way of getting out of the comparison trap you put yourself in with other writers is to remember that growth happens when we compare ourselves to our own evolution.

Real growth doesn’t come from measuring ourselves against others but from measuring our progress. Compare yourself now to yourself a month ago, three months ago, a year ago. Then, plan what you want your life to look like three months, six months, or a year from now.

Don’t worry about what others are doing; put sustained effort into your writing journey and find out what you are capable of, and your writing life will expand exponentially. Complaining that you aren’t as far as such and such when you started earlier only increases that burden.

When I find myself in the comparison trap or dealing with “imposter syndrome,” I ask myself, what do I want, what could I do to grow my writing chops?

Then I answer the question. It is usually something straightforward, like read a book on writing or take a writing class. And then, I do it. I’m continually pushing myself to get better, and one of the ways I do this is sitting down to write every day.",https://medium.com/the-partnered-pen/four-reasons-you-wont-make-it-as-a-professional-writer-941eb004c9bc,Jessica Lynn,2020-11-02 12:47:39.954000+00:00,"Entrepreneurship,Self-awareness,Productivity,Money,Writing"
5 Tactics to Keep Writing when No One is Reading Your Work,"“If you live for the love of other’s, you will die from their rejection.” Lecrae

Followers, claps, likes, and views all have one thing in common — they’re distractions. These stats distract from the reason you started writing to begin with and that’s to create quality content that people everyone can enjoy reading.

We already live in a world with too many distractions. Our faces are magnetized to our cell phones, we have jobs to do to pay bills, and too many social media notifications is constantly barking at us like a dog that you forgot to feed. It’s a constant feeling of overwhelm and it can take away from your artistic quality.

This feeling of overwhelm is elevated even more so, when you allow it to interfere with your work as a writer. Whether you write as a passion or as means to generate revenue, it’s always important to maintain creative control of your work. When you allow superficial concepts such as followers and claps to determine your work, your writing will inevitably suffer. Nothing you write will feel good enough because you’re constantly searching for external approval instead of allowing your creativity to take over. At this point, you’re no wonder a writer but an entertainer to the masses.

I have personally struggled with this myself and I’m only recently learning to cut through the overwhelm and prioritize my writing. I have at least ten different drafts that I have started but never finished due to a fear that none of it will be good enough. This has been going on for the past three months but its been a constant life struggle for me.

For example, you start writing then you lose hope that it will amount to anything because you have very few followers and no claps on your past articles. Maybe you publish your article but notifications never go off on your Medium app so you slowly lose interest and wondering if you’re wasting your time. That’s my struggle with validation and it may be your struggle as well.

Recently, after my 26th birthday, I came to the realization that if I ever want to be a great writer, I have to do it for myself and no one else.

5 Reasons Why You Find It Hard To Wake Up At Early Everyday,"There’s been quite a bit of talk on the internet both for and against waking up at 5 AM in the morning. As someone who has religiously woken up early and also outright avoided it, I have arguments on both sides. What I’ve come to the conclusion, though, is that while it certainly can be beneficial — it certainly isn’t necessary for being productive.

Business Insider, Inc. Magazine and Fast Company have all recently published articles about how waking up early can actually be harmful to your productivity. While it has been helpful and can be proof of someone’s self-discipline and aspirations, it isn’t necessary and isn’t necessarily the key.

Here are some reminders as to why you shouldn’t force yourself to wake up early if it isn’t helpful for you:

1 || You find that you resent yourself for following the 5 am crowd

Most people start waking up early, not because of their desire to get a head start on things, but because they heard that one successful person did it and wanted to follow suit.

The problem is, when you so aggressively follow the proverbial crowd, you’ll start to resent yourself and the activity of waking up early every day, rain or shine. Waking up early on a consistent basis is not easy and it doesn’t come naturally to most people. If you don’t get in touch with a solid why for waking up early, you’ll wake up lost, tired, confused, and resentful of this obscure habit you’re trying to establish for no apparent reason.

2 || You deprive yourself of sunlight

I didn’t realize this until weeks into my 5 AM habit — that waking up early when the sun didn’t rise until 6:30 AM, like now, meant that I was awake, in the dark, alone, for an hour and a half. As a social person and a human being who requires sunlight to maintain a high quality of life, this was pretty harmful to my psyche.

According to the Telegraph, women who don’t sunbathe are twice as more likely to die than those who do sunbathe every summer. While this isn’t exactly an argument for not waking up at 5 AM, it does provide an interesting point. Being around sunlight is healthy, and improves both our physical and emotional health. This is especially important in the mornings.

3 || You negate the importance of high-quality sleep

Waking up in the morning isn’t inherently bad. The problems begin to arise when you value waking up early over getting high-quality sleep. While some people are able to wake up and operate with under 4 hours of sleep, most people need somewhere between 7–9 hours of sleep.

Setting your alarm for 5 AM every day isn’t helpful to you if you’re never getting enough sleep. And not only would you be depriving yourself of sleep, but you would also be reinforcing the false idea in your mind that sleep isn’t important. My story, 10 Ways To Guarantee Better Sleep, can give you some ideas on how to sleep better and how to develop a mindset that knows the importance of sleep.

4 || You’re losing your social life

Okay, okay. I know this one is a little bit extreme, but it’s true. If you are trying to value sleep, have a solid routine, and also want to be around people and be active late at night with said party people, you’re not going to be able to have that much of social life.

When people want to hang out with you or invite you out for a night on the town, you’re not able to do so because you have to stick to your schedule. Committing to wake up at 5 AM every morning takes away your flexibility in a way that can make you say no to things you don’t want to — just so you can have an extra hour or two in the morning. You have to ask, is this worth it? Most of the time, prioritizing your favorite people over your morning routine is the better decision.

5 || You know you can experience a different kind of productivity at night

There are actual genes in your body associated with whether you’re a morning person or a night owl. If you happen to be someone who’s more naturally a night owl in accordance with your circadian rhythm, rejecting the trend of waking up at 5 AM in the morning could actually be the best choice you make in terms of being more productive in the long run.

I, personally, have never felt more inclined towards waking up early in the morning or staying up late at night. I enjoy both and try and enjoy different parts at during different seasons in my life. But what I have noticed about the evening is that, when the sun is going down and my brain’s slowing down, processing the day, and slowly falling asleep, I’m less inhibited and am more willing to be creative.",https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/5-reasons-why-you-find-it-hard-to-wake-up-at-early-everyday-d91f06c1252e,Katie E.

"Ecosystem restoration, reviving hope.","Photo by Nikola Jovanovic on Unsplash

Land degradation is a worldwide issue affecting more than 3.2 billion. When the land is degraded through soil erosion, salinization or pollution, it loses its wildlife and its ecosystem services.

In the future, it will be important to rehabilitate degraded landscapes and seascape to restore their productivity. Moreover, land restoration is especially important to mitigate climate change as forests, coral reefs and wetlands can store a huge quantity of carbon.

As young people are taking the streets to call for climate action and asking adults to join the next global climate strike in September, a momentum is taking shape and open an opportunity to push governments to act against climate change.

“Now that people are aware of the existential threat of climate change, we must give them solutions”

People have a lot of energy and are eager to change the status quo, but how do we channel this energy to have the biggest impact? That is the question asked by Tim Christophersen, focal point for the UN decade project for land restoration. In a webinar last week on land restoration, he stressed that everybody has a role to play in this mass movement but not everybody knows what to do. For example, people can plant the wrong trees at a bad time, bad place and the tree can die, and once a farmer experience failure, he will never plant a tree again.

Tim Christophersen highlighted that “the momentum comes after many years of work in land restoration, and that now we have a large knowledge about terrestrial ecosystem restoration but also marine ecosystem restoration like mangroves and coral reefs. Now that people are aware of the existential threat of climate change, we must give them solutions and shift negative views to the opportunities we have”.

“inspiring action by measuring the potential of land restoration to stop climate change”

Thomas Crowther and Jean Francois Bastin, two researchers from the university ETH Zurich explained the goal of their research: “inspiring action by measuring the potential of land restoration to stop climate change”. With such measure, people can understand the size of the problem and how they can contribute to solve it. At the webinar organized by the Global Landscape Forum, Thomas Crowther gave an interesting example: “there are 300 extra gigaton of CO2 in the atmosphere, this is the size of the problem. If everybody stops to eat meat, it is 66 gigaton which will not be emitted”.

The two researchers did the same kind of calculation for land restoration around the globe using geospatial and ecological data. They have mapped how much tree can grow in each part of the world. The model they developed was based on the biophysical data of protected areas. Then, they extrapolated to all the globe to see how much trees could grow around the globe. This model finally gave information about the potential of land restoration to reduce climate change.

When everybody thinks about geoengineering and technological solutions, people forget that natural solutions are also an option. According to the results of the research which will be published next month in Science, Jean Francois Bastin affirms that ecosystem restoration will be the first climate solution in the world.

“…because planting trees is not the only way to restore a land”

To uncover the potential of land restoration, there are many challenges to overcome. Mathilde Iweins, an expert of ecosystem services and local finance at the FAO, listed 7 challenges to widely implement land restoration.

First, many countries lack of coordination between their stakeholders within governments and ministries. Planning must be more integrative and in agreement with the people doing restoration otherwise new infrastructure may be built on a restored area.

Second, land tenure issues must be solved, and farmers should receive land titles otherwise they will not be motivated to care and restore the land.

Third, trainings about new types of land restoration must be created and shared because planting trees is not the only way to restore a land.

Forth, restoration must be linked to livelihood so people can see the benefits they can receive through land restoration.

Fifth, financial partnership must be created as the public sector cannot tackle the problem by itself. The private sector must be involved and see the economic benefits of land restoration.

Sixth, biophysical and social effect of land restoration must be monitored, evaluated and linked to a cost-benefit analysis. Such analysis will show investors the benefits to restore degraded land.

Lastly, restoration does not happen fast, and time will be needed. In a system where international donors expect results after 4 years; restoration project does not have enough time.

Fortunately, restoration projects are already ongoing and international donors have already invested 50 million USD to start a dozen of projects in 10 countries. These projects which were developed in the same way, are part of an initiative of global knowledge sharing and capacity building. All these projects use the same monitoring and evaluation methods as well as the same set of biophysical and social indicators. Thanks to that, these projects are generating comparable data about their benefits and challenges so we can improve the implementation and financing of future projects.

“it is a crucial and cheap tool we can use to solve climate change”

There is a lot to be learnt as there is no golden bullet, and land restoration is a constant experimentation. Countries, especially in the global south, will need assistance to carry on large-scale restoration projects. They will have to learn how to use geospatial data and online platforms to find the suitable land to restore. If we can manage all the challenges and harness the potential of land restoration, it is a crucial and cheap tool we can use to solve climate change.",https://medium.com/environmental-intelligence/ecosystem-restoration-reviving-hope-3dd8f7fc082f,Thuận Sarzynski,2019-06-17 08:39:15.804000+00:00,"Climate Change,Environment,Science,Sustainability,Future"

Rhett Wilkinson Follow Aug 21, 2019 · 3 min read

Just six years ago, Alex Boye entrenched himself in the predominant culture in Utah when he performed in opposition to gay marriage. And that was already while benefitting from the same culture. Boye performed for seven years for the choir representing the Latter-day Saint (ex-Mormon) church. That’s the institution underlying the predominant culture in Utah that is marginalizing the depressed and suicidal, many of whom are gay.

Now, Boye is doing a concert in the very same town as where he proclaimed opposition to gay marriage. But this time, to go against suicides, even though it seems clear that some of the suicides are a result of marginalization of gays by that predominant culture.

(Jan Chamberlin left the choir when she thought it was wrong to benefit from a cultural item.)

A Boye spokeswoman pointed The Seer Stone to a video Boye released about why he believes in fighting suicides. Boye said he had an impression to write a song, now called “Bend Not Break.” The night he told music engineers that — and that they needed to not go home yet but work on the song — is the same night as the one-year anniversary of one of the engineer’s best friend taking his life. The best friend said that night that he had thought about one thing he could have said to his friend to make him change his mind.

Boye also talks about the Herriman, Utah community supporting Boye making a music video in the area about suicide prevention. Boye also said that he gets messages from therapists who show Boye’s music video to patients.

“I feel like all my dreams are coming through just through this one song,” Boye said after talking further about life experiences that informed his making the music video.

A Boye colleague told Boye: “When you release this song, it will define your whole career.”

One girl went from cutting herself, hating herself, to feeling “the chills” after listening to the song for the first time.

“Something in of her just kind of registered. And she said ‘I’m never going to do this anymore,’” Boye said. “She sends messages every now and then; she said ‘Look, I’ve struggled at times, but I’ve never gone that far.”

“That’s mind-blowing for me,” Boye said.

Even if you no longer affiliate with the Latter-day Saint (ex-Mormon) church but enjoy sociality with family and friends as before, you can still find social settings organized by the Utah Valley PostMormons. There, you can find your people. And of course, if you don’t enjoy those relationships like before, the many UVPM events that happen each week can be even life-saving.

Led by wonderful people, UVPM is also for folks who just are struggling with it or are “never Mormons” seeking a break from the predominant culture. Find their events on Facebook and Meetup.

Datalake File Ingestion: From FTP to AWS S3,"More insight into our code:

Lets now discuss each section of our FTPIngestion class in some detail.

init method

This is the init method also called as the constructor of our class. When we create an object of our FTPIngestion class all the attributes get set at object creation time. Values for each attribute are being fetched from the config.py class where we have defined their values. We import the config.py file as cfg and set each attribute with its corresponding value.

init method

Recommendation: instead of using the config.py class we can use AWS SSM where we define our key value pairs for each of our attribute just like we did in our config.py file. Using SSM is more robust and secure.

create_ssh_connection method

This method creates a secure ssh connection with our FTP server using the given credentials. On successful connection it sets the self.ssh_ok attribute to True and returns. Otherwise self.ssh_ok is set to False and returned.

one thing to notice in this method is the self.ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy( paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()). We configured it to set the missing host keys with a auto generated policy. If you’re going to run this in AWS Glue as python shell job, instead of adding the auto add policy, use the host policies. For this, do the following in the code

#self.ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

# in production, use load_system_host_keys

self.ssh_client.load_system_host_keys()

create_sftp_connection method

This method calls the create_ssh_connection method creates the ssh connection and then proceeds to open the SFTP connection. On successful connection it sets the self.sftp_ok to True and on failure sets it to False and returns the value.

create_sftp_connection method

move_files_to_processed method

This method is called in the initiate_ingestion method after the file is successfully uploaded to s3. This method take the file name as argument. Sets the source and destination paths on the FTP server as src and dest, and then executes the following command which will move the file from the src path to the dest path.

try:

_, _, _ = self.ssh_client.exec_command(""mv "" + src+"" "" + dest) except Exception as error:

print(""error moving files to processed directory, error: "", error)

Our move_files_to_processed method is as follows:

move_files_to_processed method

create_s3_partition method

This method creates the s3 partition structure. The partition consists of root directory name followed by year, month,day,hour. In this way we can have a time based partitioned data.

create_s3_partition method

s3_upload_file_multipart method

This method uploads the files to the specified s3 bucket. It uses the TransferConfig class to handle the multipart upload. We specify the configurations for TransferConfig as follows:

config = TransferConfig(multipart_threshold=cfg.MULTIPART_THRESHOLD,

multipart_chunksize=cfg.MULTIPART_CHUNKSIZE,

max_concurrency=cfg.MAX_CONCURRENCY,

use_threads=cfg.USER_THREADS

)

the multipart_threshold parameter determines the minimum size of file that should be after which the file will be uploaded via multipart. AWS recommends all files greater than 100MB be uploaded via multipart, so I have set this parameter to 100MB. This can be changed in the config.py file.

parameter determines the minimum size of file that should be after which the file will be uploaded via multipart. AWS recommends all files greater than 100MB be uploaded via multipart, so I have set this parameter to 100MB. This can be changed in the config.py file. the multipart_chunksize parameter determines the size of each part during multipart upload. I have set it to 20MB.

parameter determines the size of each part during multipart upload. I have set it to 20MB. the max_concurrency parameter determines the maximum number of concurrent S3 API transfer operations that should be used to upload each part. Default is 10.

parameter determines the maximum number of concurrent S3 API transfer operations that should be used to upload each part. Default is 10. lastly the use_threads parameter determines whether transfer operations use threads to implement concurrency. Thread use can be disabled by setting the use_threads attribute to False. If thread use is disabled, transfer concurrency does not occur. Accordingly, the value of the max_concurrency attribute is ignored.

We pass this config object to our s3.upload_fileobj as parameter

self.s3.upload_fileobj(source_file, self.s3_bucket_name,

s3_target_file, Config=config)

The TransferConfig class automatically checks whether to upload the file as a single part or via multipart. It automatically handles the failed uploads and takes care of retries in case of failures.

s3_upload_file_multipart method

initiate_ingestion method

This method initiates the calls to establish ssh and sftp connections. Changes FTP directory path to specified path where the files reside. Gets list of all the files in the FTP specified path and starts upload to s3. Files Successfully uploaded to S3 gets moved into the processed directory on FTP server. Once all files are uploaded closes all the connections.

close_connections method

This mehtod is used to close the ssh and sftp connections.

Using the code as AWS Glue Job

As mentioned earlier, the same implementation can be used in a managed environment such as AWS Glue. If user has files arriving on the FTP server at a certain time period (hour, day, month etc) he can schedule the job to run at a specific time to ingest all the files from the FTP server to s3.

We have to modify a few things in our code to be able to run this implementation as an AWS Glue Python shell job

In our imports section of python_glue_injestion_job.py file uncomment the following import. We are using easy install to install the paramiko module in the Glue Environment since it does not come with default Python installation.

install_path = os.environ['GLUE_INSTALLATION'] easy_install.main( [""--install-dir"", install_path, ""https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ac/15/4351003352e11300b9f44 a13576bff52dcdc6e4a911129c07447bda0a358/paramiko-2.7.1.tar.gz""] ) reload(site)

in create_ssh_connection method comment following

#self.ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

and uncomment the follwoing

self.ssh_client.load_system_host_keys()

what we are doing is instead of using an auto generated policy we are using the host keys of the environment we are in.

After doing above steps we can run this code in as a Python shell job in AWS Glue.

Summary

In this article, we looked at how can perform the data ingestion step of a Datalake pipeline. We learned how we can use the paramiko library to create a secure ssh SFTP connection with a FTP server and upload files from the server to our AWS S3 buckets. We also briefly looked at how we can use the given implementation in a managed environment such as AWS Glue.

"Only 49% of Americans Plan to Get Vaccinated Against COVID-19. Yes, You Should Be That Shocked","I am always fascinated by all the wonderful things people can create. Vaccines are one of those things. We have the ability to find ways to become immune to viruses without getting sick.

But sometimes, people can really disappoint me.

A survey conducted by the AP-NORC Center in May 2020 showed that 49% of Americans plan to get vaccinated, 20% don’t, and 31% are unsure.

Image by apnorc.org

Old people are more willing to get vaccinated than young people. It partly surprised me, because old people tend to be more skeptical in general. But it’s also true that they are the ones who risk more lethal complications.

White people are more will willing to get vaccinated than Blacks or Hispanics. I personally think that this has more to do with the economical status than with the race. Minorities have a lower average income than Whites in the US. They may be worried about the direct and indirect costs of vaccination. But it’s just my personal hypothesis.

Democrats are more willing to get vaccinated than Republicans. It didn’t really surprise me. As a liberal, I know I can be biased, and I know that there are very smart conservatives too, so don’t take it personally. But the numbers speak for themselves here. Also, I was a bit surprised that Independents are the most unsure. Maybe, since they are very moderate in their political views, they tend to be very moderate in everything? Not that it’s a bad thing.

Image by apnorc.org

The reasons why one would get the vaccine are obvious. Protecting oneself, one’s family, and the community are the most common ones. But I was really curious about the reasons one would not get the vaccine.

Image by apnorc.org

All these reasons, except the allergy one, are very concerning. We will explore the top five in a moment.

Similar studies have been done everywhere. In Europe, the situation isn’t much different. A similar poll has been conducted in Italy, where I live, and it shows similar results.

Image by quotidianosanita.it

It translates to “I am willing to get vaccinated if a vaccine against COVID-19 will be identified”. The answers, left to right, are: “absolutely unlikely”, “somewhat unlikely”, “neither unlikely nor likely”, “somewhat likely”, “very likely”.

In the rest of this story, I will explore the reasons why people won’t get vaccinated, while also analyzing the psychology behind them.

Ignorance Is As Deadly As the Virus

Photo by Roman Kraft on Unsplash

It’s not news that there is a lot of misinformation about vaccines. This is a major concern, to the point that the World Health Organization listed “vaccine hesitancy” as one of the 10 major global health threats. And it was in 2019, before COVID.

Without even talking about the made-up causality between vaccines and autism, which is a conspiracy theory held by a minority, there are other unfounded concerns held by a larger share of the population. Let’s take another look at those shown by the poll:

“I would be concerned about side effects from the vaccine”. Yes, vaccines have side effects and no vaccine is 100% safe. But these side effects are no worse or more frequent than any drug you normally take. A vaccine will be deployed only after it will be scientifically proven that the benefits outweigh the risks.

“I would be concerned about getting infected with the coronavirus from the vaccine”. That’s the whole point! You get infected so that you build immunity, but with a virus that is weakened and unable to reproduce.

“I’m not concerned about getting seriously ill from the coronavirus”. More on that later.

“I don’t think vaccines work very well”. It’s true that most vaccines don’t have a 100% efficacy rate. A new vaccine is needed for influenza every year. But what do you have to lose? Even if the vaccine won’t work perfectly on you, it will probably still give you a partial immunity, and you would get less serious symptoms from an infection.

“The coronavirus outbreak is not as serious as some people say it is”. Are we still doing that? Coronavirus has already killed more than influenza normally does in a year without the lockdown. Coronavirus may be just like a bad flu for some people, but it’s been proven that it’s way more contagious.

It’s so disheartening that scientists are working hard on a vaccine to end this global crisis, but their efforts can be rendered worthless by mere human ignorance.

People Are Getting Bored with COVID, It’s Not Frightening Anymore

Photo by Jade Masri on Unsplash

After three months stuck at home, we got used to COVID. Now it’s part of our normal life, and we don’t care anymore.

Fear has diminished. Most countries have eased the lockdown and expect people to behave with common sense, adopting good habits like wearing masks. But people won’t do something that is not mandatory if it’s even a bit uncomfortable. It’s too hot to wear masks now. Who cares?

Take BLM protests, for example. I fully support the reasons behind these protests, but this was the worst timing possible. Furthermore, allow me to get a bit off-topic and share an unpopular opinion. It’s not like they are going to fix anything. Racism in the US is too deep-rooted in the nation’s history. Slavery in the past created a vicious circle in which racism and low opportunities for Blacks fed each other. Even after they were granted equal rights, Blacks got fewer chances to prove themselves and this further amplified racist views. Protests may alleviate some symptoms, but it will take much more to fix racism.

Fortunately, though, studies show that these protests didn’t increase the spread of COVID. So, why am I saying all this? The point I want to make is how little people care about COVID now. Most people knew that these protests would have increased the spread, even if it didn’t happen. But they didn’t care.

To make matters worse, most people have started to think that COVID has gotten weaker with summer weather.

This is not true. A virus never “gets weaker” on its own. It can only get stronger. It’s basic evolution.

Yes, the exponential spread has partially slowed down with the higher temperature. But this is only because, with hot weather, saliva drops evaporate faster, and the virus spreads with more difficulty. Yet the virus itself is the same as before.

After the summer, the spread will accelerate again, and we will likely get a second wave. If anything, the virus can only get more contagious with the summer, to adapt to a more difficult environment. But this is just my hypothesis, and I’m not a virologist, so I won’t make further predictions.

This summer is the quiet before the storm. At least in Europe, things look good for now. In Italy, we are getting just 100–200 new cases every day. But in the US, with its government’s poor management, things look very, very bad. And people just don’t care anymore.

Your Actions Matter. Remember, It All Started With a Single Person

Photo by Morning Brew on Unsplash

One of the reasons why people wouldn’t get vaccinated was the following: “I’m not concerned about getting seriously ill from the coronavirus”.

This is either ignorant or just selfish. As we are required to wear masks to protect others, we should get vaccinated not only to protect ourselves, but also to avoid being potential carriers of the virus. In other words, if you don’t get vaccinated, you may put several other people at risk.

And it’s not just the 2–3 people you can directly infect. Each of these people is another potential carrier that could infect another 2–3 people. This could grow exponentially and hundreds or thousands of people could get infected because you didn’t get vaccinated (and neither did they). Remember, it all started with a single person.

As I’m writing this, there are almost 11,500,000 confirmed cases, while the actual number is probably 5 or 10 times higher. All it took was just one person.

So, even if you don’t care about getting sick, you should get vaccinated for your friends, family, and community. It can actually make a difference.

According to estimates, 50 to 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.

Vaccination is an act of social responsibility. It’s not enough to fight fake news about vaccines, people should also be made aware of the importance of vaccination as a duty towards others.

The virus itself is not the only challenge we are facing in this pandemic. The role of our opinions and decisions as responsible citizens poses a bigger challenge that will shape our future even beyond the pandemic.",https://medium.com/i-human/only-49-of-americans-plan-to-get-vaccinated-against-covid-19-yes-you-should-be-that-shocked-973fe453cd42,Luca Rossi,2020-07-05 21:46:00.015000+00:00,"Health,Covid 19,Society,Coronavirus,Science"
The Importance of Blank Space on Your Calendar,"Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash

It is very easy these days to find ourselves overcommitted and overwhelmed as we try to “fit it all in.”

There are many demands for our time and attention, pulling us in a thousand different directions, and countless distractions to derail us from what really matters.

It is all too common to find ourselves busy nonstop throughout the day without any space for real thinking. After all, when our lives are so hectic, isn’t it an unrealistic luxury to set dedicated time aside for thinking and reflecting?

That is the default mindset for many, but author Greg McKeown provides an alternative viewpoint in his New York Times best-selling book, Essentialism (a fantastic book about doing less, but better, in all areas of our lives).

He says,“The faster and busier things get, the more we need to build thinking time into our schedule. And the noisier things get, the more we need to build quiet reflection spaces in which we can truly focus.”

McKeown cites Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn, who schedules up to two hours of uninterrupted time on his calendar every day.

Weiner started this practice when back-to-back meetings began consuming his schedule. Initially, blocking out blank space felt like an indulgence, but now he credits it with being his single-most important productivity tool.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos follows a similar model. He has been known to keep two days per week unstructured in order to think, generate new ideas, and take a long-term perspective instead of getting buried in the day-to-day.

Another example is Bill Gates who has habitually taken a week off (twice a year) simply to read and to think. Just in case this only seems possible for Gates at this stage in his career, it turns out that his “Think Week” ritual dates back to the early 1980s and has been maintained during even the most stressful business times at Microsoft and his foundation.

As McKeown says, “No matter how busy you think you are, you can carve time and space to think out of your workday.”

Maybe it could be first thing in the morning instead of checking email, or in the afternoon as an alternative to social media.

Whether it is two hours per day, two days per week, or two weeks per year, we need to make it a point to block out time specifically to think.

This space is vital in order to prioritize our life and work, and to focus our energy in the most meaningful areas.

But it will only happen if we deliberately design it into our calendar.",https://andrewmerle.medium.com/the-importance-of-blank-space-on-your-calendar-c1a5f0e727fc,Andrew Merle,2018-11-27 20:52:54.926000+00:00,"Technology,Health,Productivity,Creativity,Entrepreneurship"
A Goodbye to Golden Muzzles: Internal Dissent and the Cautionary Tale of Facebook,"In 2019, former CIA agent Yael Eisenstat was specifically hired by Facebook to help reform how the company works with political disinformation and politic ads that contain lies. She quickly bounced out, outraged at Facebook’s inability to take a sober look in the mirror. In short order, she became a vocal critic.

Yael sees reforming Facebook as the best and most viable path forward. The social media platform has fended off or absorbed dozens of would-be competitors in the last decade and grown to become a media empire. Facebook’s network effects, reaching more than 2 billion people and counting, are unassailable. The company is a source of American pride and the projection of soft power. But it has also proven an Achilles heel for American democracy, vulnerable to Russia, China and other actors who have fractured and divided us, sewn discord and unrest, successfully diminishing America’s standing in the world. Some would now argue Facebook and other social media to a lesser degree, have been the drivers pushing America to the brink of a new civil war.

Though Zuckerberg himself engages weekly with Facebook employees, in AMA sessions where dissent is ostensibly encouraged, he did not alter the company’s content policies until his own personal wealth saw a $7B hit, as share price fell due to the ad boycott. Money talks, apparently. For Zuckerberg, it may be the only voice he listens to.

Privately, many people I’ve spoken with in technology, or who cover technology for major news outlets are skeptical as well of the recent Facebook oversight board. Off the record several have characterized this move as a pre-emptive attempt at self-regulation to stave off any government oversight, oversight that might have teeth and impose real sanctions for hate speech or lies that have serious criminal or geo-political impacts.

I’m not sure if this is true myself. It would be commendable if an oversight committee had real independence, a group that could not be overruled by Zuckerberg on a whim and could make binding choices that might even result in less revenues but greater civic responsibility. If recent experience is any teacher, such choices would likely never be approved by Zuckerberg. It’s probably true that this will only happen in a substantive way through legislation from Congress.



At present I’m in the minority of my friends who are still using the platform. Those of us who have not yet abandoned Facebook are there because of all the ways we can connect with people we love, admire or miss around the world, data harvesting be damned. The platform does provide connection and opportunity.

I’ve done all I can to moderate my own feed towards civil discourse, learning, discovery and debate in a spirit of mutual respect. We try to eschew the outrage that sadly has become the norm for grabbing and retaining people’s attention. But I also am under no illusion that my choices are minimal and that Facebook’s opaque algorithm is in charge of what I see and read and who sees and reads what I offer there.

I do not control my bubble. They do, and they adjust it to fit their advertisers, to maximize their own revenue and to maximize the usefulness of my data in order to sell it. If you’d like to read more on how we’re all uncompensated “data wells,” I’d recommend Tristan Harris’ Center for Humane Technology or Douglas Rushkoff’s Team Human.

One of the best things that could happen to check Facebook’s unrestrained power would be a digital data rights piece of legislation such as that proposed by Andrew Yang’s Humanity Forward organization. If people were paid for their data and could collectively bargain for how it is used, we might get to retain Facebook’s benefits without the company racking up more moral failures and more unchecked power. I personally don’t see how this could operate without a self-sovereign digital identity, a one true encrypted version of each of us online, to which rights, protections and responsibilities could accrue, just as they do in the physical world. In fact this is still a project I hope to work on in the future.

So, what would Facebook be like now, if dissent had been genuinely valued, in such a way that it resulted in real flexibility on issues like limits on freedom of speech?

And what can startups in their infancy, but with Facebook-scale ambitions, learn from turning internal dissent into an advantage for the organization? How might dissent be an engine for positive civil impact as economic milestones are achieved?

The Advantages of Dissent

Given the incentives and rules of the shareholder economy, most companies today operate a bit like a constitutional monarchy, with a parliamentary function embodied by a board and shareholders, meant to keep executives (the monarchs) in check. Oversight is meant to prevent abuses or harms that might affect the bottom line, or potentially generate negative legal repercussions. These tend to be cold and unfeeling calculations.

There is no real oversight beyond this dynamic for moral hazard — we haven’t yet built that into how our economies operate.

There are more cases than warrant cataloguing for greed overriding principle in the behavior of corporate leaders. In fact it’s common that CSR and philanthropic initiatives operate to whitewash ill-gotten gains. If you want a fascinating at length exposé, consider Anand Giridharadas’ book Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.

And if you believe as I do, that the majority of power in our world is currently operative in the corporate sphere, then you may also agree that we as a global culture have politically devolved. In the last 500 years, we’ve moved from feudalism to democracy to corporate feudalism as the dominant forms of power shaping our lives today.

How might we bring more democratic principles into corporations?



Some companies have experimented with structures such as Holocracy, or what Noam Chomsky once referred to as “anarcho-syndicalist communities,” typified by Burning Man. The hope here was to flatten hierarchies and create dynamic self-directed teams to produce products, solve problems and achieve deliverables, whether shipping shoes or building theme camps or art cars. Once achieved, the team could dissolve and join new teams in a constantly evolving fashion that would render the traditional org chart obsolete and provide the intrinsic fulfillment of novel initiatives for all involved. These attempts were most famously piloted by Zappos and its CEO Tony Hsieh. Amongst the tech community and written about here in the NY Times, these experiments are now mostly considered to be failures, not producing greater employee satisfaction or superior outcomes.

But this was just one experiment.

If we are going to evolve the ways companies function and perhaps infuse them with more democratic processes, we’ll need to experiment a lot more than this. There’s a near infinite number of possibilities for democratizing internal operations as well as public access to internal decision making and overall accountability.

And we’ll need to look at how open dialogue can be turned to competitive advantage. Less dramatic experiments with more egalitarian decision making and structure have been trialed at Patagonia and at REI and other co-ops throughout the world.

And the promised land may include some element of Pixar, but with a more inventive governance structure. Pixar famously enshrined psychological safety and creativity generating rituals into its company in robust ways that have proven resilient, even after it was acquired by Disney. A great place to read about how this was done is in Ed Catmull’s recent book, Creativity Inc.. Pixar broke down the slide towards rigidity, politics and career enough at least to ensure that the studio did not forever attempt to repeat its most profitable films and instead pushed for continuous reinvention and originality of storylines. Dissent is architected into Pixar’s daily operations.

So how might we move away from monarchy and towards democratic principles? How could such principles become an advantage for your startup? And what does this have to do with constructive conflict?



What’s come to light for me recently is the promise of collective intelligence, collective and complementary veins of creativity and problem solving. These are ideas at the forefront of social science and most of them have not really been fully applied in the context of commercial companies.

To fully benefit from complementary intelligence and talent you need to solicit the recurrent and safe voice of dissent. We need to think together. In the words of Laurie Mulvey, Director of World in Conversation, “conflict doesn’t have to be a dirty word.” You need robust trust and real disagreement, without people succumbing to “amygdala hijack,” a full blown attack of anger, because someone feels personally threatened.



For trust to blossom and unvarnished dissent to surface consistently, using Safi Bahcall’s metaphor, a garden must be tended.

Larger work cultures tend to cultivate battlefields more than gardens. They teach insecurity, scarcity, avoidance of risk, minimal agency, a war mindset, a zero sum game, with commands trickling down from the top of a pyramidal org chart. The norm is to focus on politics and career advancement. At least in America, most employees can be laid off without notice. If you speak up and become a pain in the ass, the possibility of being fired and to some degree blacklisted in an industry is real. When you’re out there hiring, this sort of conditioning is brought into your startup by most employees, no matter what your company may screen for. It’s a reasonable expectation within the job marketplace as it is. People play defense and zip their lips.

To remove the muzzles, golden or otherwise, and benefit from collective intelligence requires repetition from leadership. It requires the cultivation of a symbiotic garden wherein all elements flourish. Leaders will need to repeat that substantive moral dissent is welcome, moral questioning is welcome, to produce this kind of candor. This requires emotionally secure and wise leaders.

And though it may feel too dangerous, dissent that is visible outside of the company is not necessarily a disadvantage. A growing body of research suggests that leaders willing to express vulnerability and fallibility are far more sympathetic and credible.

Working With Dissent and Cultivating Collective Intelligence

So in conclusion for you startup founders, how might your company benefit from the collective intelligence of your founding team?

And how might you build a culture and company with enshrined rituals to benefit from dissent, from diversity of opinions that will allow you to remain flexible and adaptive as context changes and your company’s impact grows?

Here are a few suggestions.

Practice constructive conflict. Model and repeat that the culture you’re all building together is not a monarchy, that collective wrestling with tactics and with moral issues implied by the company’s activity is welcome, always. Schedule for AMAs and close the loop by telling your colleagues when their dissent or differing perspective shaped or reshaped any small or large part of the company’s operations.

Schedule for AMAs and close the loop by telling your colleagues when their dissent or differing perspective shaped or reshaped any small or large part of the company’s operations. Be a good gardener, not a military general. Devolve decision making to others as much as possible and repeat that you trust them, admire them and care deeply about their success. Call attention to their greater expertise and defer to their decisions especially when you initially disagreed with their proposals.

Devolve decision making to others as much as possible and repeat that you trust them, admire them and care deeply about their success. Call attention to their greater expertise and defer to their decisions especially when you initially disagreed with their proposals. Do the dangerous and hard thing. Develop a communications strategy that demonstrates to your customers and the public that you’re a fallible, humble, learning organization, not a uniform and obedient phalanx of soldiers gulping Kool-Aid without question. Companies that treat their work like war are increasingly mistrusted. Be relatable and human and watch public respect for what you accomplish rise. Speak from integrity, follow through and own mistakes.

Remember that Adam Smith, arguably the father of economics, was actually a moral philosopher.

Don’t just focus on tactical execution of goals, but an openness to explore and revisit the company’s raison d’être and how this does or doesn’t align with current products or services on offer.

Finally, a note on who gets to dissent. I think this is best addressed by hallowed pundit, author and syncretic thinker Malcolm Gladwell. In this short video from the BBC, he addresses social conditioning, ethnicity and bias in who is allowed to add friction and who is discouraged from doing so, all good things to be aware of if you truly want to encourage constructive dissent in your company from all voices and corners.",https://medium.com/swlh/a-goodbye-to-golden-muzzles-benefitting-from-internal-dissent-a7307f7c4891,Raman Frey,2020-12-11 13:55:38.098000+00:00,"Facebook,Conflict,Business,Trust,Startup"
Essential OpenCV Functions to Get You Started into Computer Vision,"Reading, writing and displaying images

Before we can do anything with computer vision, we need to be able to read and understand how images are processed by computers. The only information computers can process is binary information (0 and 1), this includes text, images, and video.

How do computers work with images

To understand how a computer “understands” an image yo can picture a matrix of the size of the image where on each cell you assign a value that represents the color of the image in that position.

Let’s take an example with an image in greyscale:

For this particular case, we can assign each block (or pixel) in the image a numeric value (which can be interpreted as binary). This numeric value can be from any range, though it’s a convention to use 0 for black, 255 for white, and all the integers in between to represent the intensity.

When we work with color images, things can get a bit different depending on the library and how we choose to represent the colors. We will talk more about that later in the post, however, they all share more or less the same idea, which is using different channels to represent the colors, being RGB (red, green, and blue) one of the most popular options. With RGB we need 3 channels to build each pixel, so our 2d matrix now is a 3d matrix with a depth of 3, where each channel is the intensity of a particular color, and when mixing we get the final color for the pixel.

Working with images using OpenCV

Let’s now jump into the code to perform 3 of the most important functions when dealing with images, reading, showing, and saving.

import cv2

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Reading the image

image = cv2.imread('sample1.jpg') # Showing the image

plt.imshow(image)

plt.show() # Saving the image

cv2.imwrite('sample1_output.jpg', image)

If you run our code, now you will get one image saved to disk, and another as a result of the plot.

The image on the left is the one we plotted, vs the one on the right which is the image saved to disk.

There are so many styles of writers who write on various subjects and in various themes.

There is:

The deep thinking essayist.

The lighthearted one-minute-wit writer.

The haiku poet.

The short story fiction writer.

The limerick poet.

The horror writer.

The serious poet.

The How-To writer.

The Dr. Suessy rhyming styled poet.

The self-help inspirational motivational writer.

The listicle writer.

The personal essayist

The comic writer.

The satirist.

The feverish journal writer.

To me, all of this is valuable writing. It all counts. I’ve written all of this myself.

I find it fun to experiment. Shouldn't writing be fun and enjoyable? Write it all if you want. Hey, why not try things on for size? There are no writing police (that I’m aware of!) waiting to handcuff you or take your writing permission slip away.

Well, maybe you’ll feel judged or even ostracized by your peers for stepping out of your comfort zone. I'm willing to risk that. I’m willing to risk going rogue.

How Writing 1000 Words a Day Changed my Life,"I wrote at least a thousand words a day every day from the age of twelve on. — Ray Bradbury, Zen and the Art of Writing

When I interviewed Julien Smith for the first time in 2012, he had one of the most popular blogs on the internet. Of all the things he shared with me in our conversation, one thing he said stood out to me. I write 1000 words every day.

Shortly after that conversation I started writing 1000 words a day and it’s something I’ve been doing ever since. To say that the habit changed my life would be an understatement.

It’s served as a form of meditation, therapy, and clarity.

It led to a 2 book deal with a publisher and helped me to launch a career as an author and speaker

It’s enabled me to finish a 45,000 word manuscript in 6 months and write 100’s of articles.

This simple daily habit has literally had a six figure ROI. It’s changed my life and my career.

1. A Habit Born out of Necessity

What started first out of curiosity, eventually turned into something that I had to do out of necessity. The demands on my production increased dramatically almost overnight.

I was writing 2–3 posts a week for my personal blog in addition to a weekly newsletter

I was being paid $1000 a month to write one piece a week for a client

I was writing a weekly piece for a blog at a startup that I owned a small equity stake in.

In order to keep up with the demand, I had to develop a system.

If I waited to be inspired I would be screwed

As I’ve said before, systems are essential to increasing your creative output. 1000 words a day became my system. Within a few months it was a habit so deeply ingrained into my life that it was like brushing my teeth. And that’s when things started to get really interesting.

2. The Art of Being Unmistakable

As part of my 1000 words I would publish a really long Facebook status update, what I jokingly referred to as committing career suicide one status update at a time. After a few months my writing started resonating with people like it never had before. In September of 2013, I compiled all of my Facebook status updates into a google doc, had it edited, had Mars Dorian design a book cover, uploaded it to Amazon and called it the Art of Being Unmistakable.

The first week it sold 300 copies and I considered that a success. But about three weeks later, a media circus erupted. When I check the rankings on Amazon, I noticed that my book was #1 in the entrepreneurship category. When I tweeted about it, somebody said “you might want to thank Glenn Beck. He raved about your book on his show today.” When I asked a friend she said “I don’t think you realize how big a deal this is, check your sales.” When I logged into the Amazon dashboard, I noticed that the book had sold 1000 copies in a day. Shortly after that I ended up being on the Glenn Beck show and my self published book became a Wall Street Journal Best Seller.

3. A 2-Book Deal with a Publisher

Between 2013 and 2015, I never stopped writing 1000 words a day. A few months into 2015, I got the following email from an editor at Penguin Portfolio.

I recently rejoined publishing after working at online education startups, having just left Skillshare to join the Penguin Random House team. While it might seem counterintuitive, I came back just for this specific division that works and thinks differently than most of the industry — and is setting out to help entrepreneurs and changemakers with the stories, experiences, and motivation of people who have successfully forged their own path, people like Seth Godin, Guy Kawasaki, Ryan Holiday, Nir Eyal, Nick Bilton, and more. You are one of those people, and are top of my list of who to contact to work on a book together.

Writing in many ways is like planting seeds. You plant seeds today for the person you eventually want to become. After a few conversations, my daily writing habit resulted in a 2 book deal. The first book Unmistakable: Why Only is Better Than Best was released on August 2, 2016. And I’m currently working on my second book.

So how exactly do you incorporate this habit into your life?

4. Design an Environment Conducive to Writing

You have to design an environment that’s conducive to the person you want to become. If you want to become a writer, your environment should reflect that. If you came to my apartment you would notice two things:

1) I read a lot of books

2) I have stacks of Moleskine notebooks

It’s likely that you’d notice something similar in the environment of anybody else who is a writer. When I ate dinner at Tucker Max’s house for the first time, the first thing that caught my attention was the sheer number of books he had. In Ryan Holiday’s post about maintaining a physical library you’ll see that he has multiple bookshelves that are filled from floor to ceiling.

5. Activation Energy and Success Accelerants

In his book The Happiness Advantage, the author Shawn Achor talks about how reducing the amount of energy it takes to do something increases the likelihood you’ll do it. Something as simple as decreasing the number of mouse clicks to do something will increase your odds of doing it.

The simple hack for this is using a distraction free writing tool like Macjournal. Set it up the night before, so when you flip open your laptop in the morning, it’s the first thing you see. Then you just write. If you prefer to write with a paper notebook, put it out with a pen the night before. The simple act of putting your notebook out the night before with a pen increases the likelihood that you’ll actually follow through on writing.

Another variation of this hack is to write one sentence the night before, ideally right before you go to sleep. Write down somebody else’s words. Suddenly the page appears less daunting. This is one of the many reasons I always read before I write. Since your brain makes progress towards a goal based on how close it thinks it is towards that goal, starting with a quote allows you tap into the power of success accelerants.

6. Be Prolific

“All good writing begins with terrible first efforts” — Anne Lammot

It’s likely your early writing efforts will be lousy. Don’t be afraid to write a shitty first sentence. To this day only a small amount of what I produce on a daily basis is actually usable. But when you write 7000 words a week, you don’t need much to be useable. Say you write 1000 words a week that are decent. That’s 52,000 words. That’s one book in a year. Your cumulative output matters more than any individual writing day. If you want to become a better writer, start by becoming a prolific one.

7. Don’t Judge Your Work

It’s possible during the course of 90 minutes of writing that you’ll wander. This happens to me all the time. I’ll get 3–4 paragraphs into a train of thought and suddenly I’m writing stream of consciousness psychobabble. At this point your natural temptation will be to give up or give into a source of distraction. But if you can resist this temptation and just let the verbal vomit show up on the page, you’ll get back to a place of making sense. In that sense it’s a bit like meditation. You simply observe the wandering mind and return to focusing on your breath.

8. Make it a Habit

Inspiration is an unreliable strategy for creative work. The muse is a fickle mistress and she tends to show up on her own schedule. You on the other hand have the option to show up every day. By showing up every day, you tap into the profound power of consistency. Something that starts as an item on your to do list eventually becomes a habit and you start to build momentum.

On a related note- if you struggle with habits, I’ve put a guide together on optimizing productivity & creativity. Sign up for my newsletter here and you’ll receive it shortly.

9. Always Carry a Notebook

Inspiration has a funny way of striking at unusual times. Usually you’re not in front of the computer when this happens. A habit I picked up from my friend AJ Leon is to always carry a notebook. A notebook is like fertile soil where you can plant seeds for your creative ideas.

10. Learn to Recognize Patterns

If you pay attention to how you work, you’ll start to see patterns. These patterns are incredibly useful in helping you to develop systems and mental models for you to get your work done. They give you a personal operating manual for yourself. Recognizing patterns helps you adjust your behavior to reach optimal levels of performance.

A pattern I saw in my life was that waking up before 6am and meditating led to deeper levels of flow and focus. I also knew that after 10am things seemed to go downhill and after 1pm I’m essentially worthless.

I tend to experience flow most consistently when I give myself 90 minutes of uninterrupted creation time.

If I go more than a few days without sweating or exercising, my depression and anxiety tend to be exacerbated.

I saw that text messages that weren’t responded to after I sent a text were causing me anxiety. I turned of all notifications after this.

These patterns play themselves out throughout our lives. Not just in our work. They occur in nearly every situation. You might notice something as simple as a phrase in an email that always elicits a positive response. If that’s the case it makes no sense to deviate from that pattern.

You might think that adjusting to patterns might make your life repetitive and boring, but the opposite seems to be true. The beauty of recognizing patterns in your life is that it frees up your cognitive bandwidth for much higher value activities than trying to decide how you plan to behave for the day. Recognizing patterns in your life requires you to take actually take time, slow down and reflect on the results that your behavior is producing.

Understanding your own behavioral patterns and the results they produce is the closest thing to a “success” pill you could find.

If x causes y, then it would make sense that you choose the x that causes the y that you want. As you recognize patterns you’ll begin not only work more efficiently but work more effectively. By utilizing the patterns you recognize to develop processes and systems, you free your mind up to think creatively. If your mind is taxed with decisions like how long and how much you’re depleting your willpower.

One of the most valuable sections of the BestSelf journal is Lessons learned for the day. We learn tons of lessons every day, but without the discipline to capture them, it’s no better than if we didn’t learn them at all. In fact this idea of patterns was inspired by a lesson I learned yesterday which was that 90 minutes of deep work was my consistent sweet spot. Once I saw that pattern I started looking for other ones. As you recognize patterns in your life, you’ll go from a frenetic scatterbrained pace to one that is fast paced, focused, sustainable and generates momentum.

There’s a point at which any habit you adopt eventually becomes a part of who you are. You no longer have to think about it. It’s what James Clear refers to as an identity based habit If you see in me in a coffeeshop, at a conference, or anywhere else before 8am, it’s more than likely you’ll find me writing 1000 words. This is no longer something I just do. It’s who I am. In order for a habit to truly change your life, it has to become a practice, likely one that is lifelong.",https://medium.com/the-mission/how-writing-1000-words-a-day-changed-my-life-cf72453b8fef,Srinivas Rao,2018-08-24 15:23:18.229000+00:00,"Writing,Motivation,Life,Creativity,Productivity"

Anorexia Has A Bacterial Origin, Researchers Say

It’s too naive to think anorexia arises from psychosocial factors alone, researchers argue.

Image by CoxinhaFotos from Pixabay

Sitting at the 3rd most common disease affecting adolescent females, anorexia is characterized by severe calorie restriction — comorbid with anxiety and depression — that lead to the starvation and malfunctioning of many other organs. Anorexia is titled the most fatal mental illness.

Anorexia Etiology Revisited

“Psychological factors might be important but are unconvincing as the primary or major cause [of anorexia],” James Morris and colleague from Lancaster University, UK, wrote in Medical Hypothesis in 2016.

Anorexia is a functional or psychosomatic disease; psycho means mind and somatic means body. It’s a mind-body disease caused by a combination of psychological and physical factors.

Modern views of anorexia, however, neglect the physical cause of the disease, as Morris and team argued:

There might, for instance, be an increased incidence of physical and sexual abuse in childhood in those who go on to manifest functional disorders. It is easy to see how this could influence symptoms in adults but it stretches credulity to imagine abuse as the sole and sufficient cause of the functional disorder. Equally modern concepts of the perfect physical form promoted by the fashion industry will influence teenagers to diet but surely there must be something more profound and fundamental to induce emaciation and death by starvation or suicide.

Basically, Morris et al. question the idea of psychosocial factors being the sole cause of anorexia. It’s too simplistic and crédule, they thought.

It doesn’t explain why a subset of adolescents do not develop anorexia when they have been exposed to similar childhood and cultural experiences.

Many will quickly attribute this to differences in genetics, social support or individual’s innate resilience. While these may also contribute to the overall likelihood of developing anorexia, Morris et al. asked:

What if bacteria also play a role?

When Bacteria-Fighting Antibodies Attack the Brain

Morris et al. first observed that anorexia nervosa is 10x more prevalent in females than males, and so are autoimmune diseases.

They then cited several studies that found the presence of autoantibodies — that attack the serotonin neurons and appetite-regulating hormones/peptides— roaming in the blood and hypothalamus of anorexics. The levels of these autoantibodies also correlated with the severity of the eating disorder.

The hypothalamus is a brain region that controls human's basic needs such as sleep, body temperature, thirst, and appetite. It’s also part of the limbic system — also called the reptilian brain — which is an ancient set of structures in the brain that governs instincts and emotions.

Where did these auto-antibodies come from? The studies that discovered them raised the possibility of bacterial infection(s). Upon encountering foreign entities, the immune system makes antibodies that bind to the bacteria surface — to neutralize or marked it for destruction by other immune cells.

If the bacterium shares a similar structure to some of the host’s proteins — a phenomenon called molecular mimicry — the antibodies will target both the bacteria and the host own proteins.

The fact that these antibodies — now autoantibodies — are considered as allies makes things worse. The blood-brain-barrier, for example, doesn’t see it as a threat — enabling these autoantibodies to easily enter the brain’s limbic system.

“Auto-antibodies acting on the [brain’s] limbic system could induce extremes of emotion including disgust and fear,” Morris et al. wrote. “These then become linked, in the minds of adolescent girls, to culturally determined ideas of what is, and what is not, the ideal body shape and size.

It is then a small step for disgust and fear to be directed to food and obesity which the fashion industry currently demonises.”

Linking to Gut Dysbiosis

While Morris et al. have not pinpointed a specific bacterial agent, current scientific evidence suggests that it could be gut bacteria.

Sergueï Fetissov, MD and Professor of Physiology, and colleagues from Rouen University and Hospital in France published a pioneer finding in this regard — which Morris et al. cited in his Medical Hypothesis paper.

Fetissov and team found that autoantibodies — attacking appetite-regulating peptides — in the bloodstream of anorexics have substantial sequence similarities to few known gut microbes and external pathogens.

Proteins having a similar string of amino acid sequence likely have similar structures. And similar structures indicate a higher chance of getting bound by the same antibody due to molecular mimicry.

“Numerous cases of sequence homology with these [appetite-regulating] peptides were identified among commensal and pathogenic micro-organisms including Lactobacilli, Bacteroides, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, and Candida species,” the authors wrote.

These are just some examples as they have also discovered 20 other such microbes that have similar protein sequences as the human appetite-regulating peptides. The team further showed that mice without a gut microbiome have lower levels of such autoantibodies than normal mice.

“Our data demonstrate multiple cases of molecular mimicry of regulatory peptides with microbial proteins, identifying micro-organisms as putative biological targets to be tested for their relevance to the normal or pathophysiologic mechanisms of appetite and emotion,” Fetissov et al. continued.

Linking to the Gut-Brain Axis

A 2019 review — written by Jochen Seitz, MD, and coordinator of eating disorders research at University Aachen and colleagues from Germany — took a more holistic approach to the bacterial implications of anorexia.

They look at the gut-brain axis and its associated immunology as a whole. They look at it as intricate biological machinery or systems that interact with one another (see figure below).

While providing evidence supporting that bacterial infection may confuse the immune system to make antibodies attacking the brain’s appetite-regulatory signals, they added more recent evidence on the gut microbiome profile of anorexics. Compared to non-anorexics, their gut showed a reduced microbial diversity and abnormal outgrowth of certain microbes.

“These digestive products of [microbial] protein fermentation [in anorexics] were previously found to increase PYY-production, a gastric peptide known to decrease appetite and increase depressive symptoms,” the German researchers wrote.

To Wrap It Up

A gut dysbiosis or dysregulated gut-brain axis leads to systemic inflammation, autoantibodies, and harmful microbial metabolites — all of which negatively affect the brain’s appetite signals.

This may trigger — or at least contribute to — the downward spiral leading to anorexia, in addition to genetic and psychosocial factors. To this end, Seitz et al. (2019) proposed for gut microbiome interventions in addition to traditional therapy for anorexia.

“The goals could be to increase the amount of energy harvested from the same quantity of food and to decrease gut permeability, inflammation and antibody formation, with the potential consequence of reducing depressive and anxious symptoms,” Seitz and colleagues emphasized.

Here Is A Creative Exercise in Futuristic Storytelling and Worldbuilding,"Image created by Author

Imagine that you are a storyteller and/or a screenwriter. It is the year 2120. A starship is leaving the Earth. 12 crew members are on it. You will create a science fiction story using this prompt.

Please follow the steps below and try to quickly respond to each question. You might use quick bullet points. Keep writing and keep it flowing. Enjoy!

Describe the starship. What is its name? Technical or technological features? Imagine its advanced technology. Imagine futurist technologies of the day. Implications? How are they traveling? Why is this starship leaving the Earth? Think of the reason(s) and the back story. Initiate the story: What are the events that trigger this starship to leave the Earth? Think of the mission of this starship. Where are they going? Why? What is their mission? What are the obstacles and challenges facing crew members? Think about these 12 characters/crew members. Who are they? Where do they come from? What makes them tick? Any pains? Are they haunted by their past? What about their personality? Any hidden agendas? Any special talents or super-powers? Ego issues? Vulnerabilities? Who are the biggest adversaries/enemies? What are their plans? How will they act? How do they pose a threat? Describe the events that lead to tensions/conflict. How do these events unfold? What is at stake? How do our heroes act? How do they deal with these threats/challenges? How do they transcend the obstacles? How do they transcend themselves? How do they face the darkness in themselves or in their enemies? How do they fall into darkness/traps/obstacles? How do they overcome these? Any conflicts or trust issues among crew members? How and why? How do they resolve these issues and solve the problems? Think of a few cliffhangers and a finale that will satisfy your readers or viewers.

Do not judge your ideas and keep your ideas flowing.

Following these steps and writing down your ideas quickly will help you get started in worldbuilding, screenwriting, and storytelling.

I know a few of you will disagree with me. “But Jason. You can’t force the creative process!” or, “If you have to force it, you shouldn’t be blogging in the first place!” I can see the comments when I publish this sucker.

A lot of people write for the pure joy and ecstasy of it. They write to free their mind and stretch their artistic muscles. While I aspire to be that way, I can’t truthfully say it is how writing and blogging are for me.

I blog for three reasons:

To earn money For therapy In the hopes that my stories can help another person get through difficult circumstances

I write a lot about mental health and how to overcome obstacles keeping you back in life. I write about blogging and entrepreneurship. I write about my family, my travels, and how to get a better life.

I write what I know.

I know why I have not been a smashing success and shot up to $10K a month on Medium — because I write about myself too much. Instead of writing about what’s in it for my audience, I write more “How to Survive if Your Life is Shit” pieces. Good-looking self-help gurus are much more marketable than the steaming pile of dooky that has been me and my life for 52 years.

I know I’m not where I want to be on Medium because I cannot fully embrace the listicle or the “10 Quotes from Elon Musk that will Make You A Better Writer” post.

It’s just not me, and even though I have “making money” as my number one reason for blogging, I can’t force myself to write clickbait headlines and vanilla pudding content.

Because the fact is that most times, I have to force myself to sit down and write, and I can’t push myself to write junk I don’t believe in.

You have to understand what is going on in my mind right now:

Voices are screaming at the top of their lungs, back and forth to each other, and the topic is me and what a shit writer I am. The voices are spouting the ugliest and most hateful things about me and my failure to do anything with my life. In the background, and equally noisy, I hear all the sounds from throughout my day playing at the same time at full-blast.

And, sitting in a little corner is my inner Jason — the voice that narrates my life moment by moment- the muse that helps me put words to the page.

My muse gets beaten and battered but takes it all with a smile on his face. He knows I have to be tough on him and not let him fall victim to the crap going on behind him. As exhausted as he is from putting up with the racket 24 hours a day, I still have to be firm with him so that I can write.

He wants to be comfortable and only write when inspired or in the mood. But I know him. If I wait until he is in the perfect mindset to create, I will be waiting forever, and my life will stagnate.

So I encourage and even raise my voice, even though I know he is doing his best. I crack the whip when he doesn’t wake up, and I push and prod him to keep his eyes open.

I promise him a long vacation somewhere with snow, wine, and every delicious kind of food he dreams about in his chubby little dreams.",https://medium.com/blog-differently/tell-your-mood-to-f-ck-off-push-your-mind-harder-and-create-3e2255b6a002,Jason Weiland,2020-11-05 19:10:29.827000+00:00,"Writing,Blogging,Mental Health,Productivity,Creativity"
It’s Now or Never for a Green New Deal,"Some sports fans will remember Doug Flutie’s epic Hail Mary throw in the final seconds of the Orange Bowl in 1984. The throw was an act of desperation as there were only 6 seconds left at the beginning of the play, and a field goal was not an option as Boston College was down by 4 points. Flutie called the “55 Flood Tip” play, which sent three receivers straight down the field in the hopes that if one didn’t get a clean catch, another receiver might tip ball in their favor. This is of course not a perfect metaphor for our current climate situation, but the notion of a Hail Mary play should resonate with an American audience.

As a society, we only have a small set of options moving forward in the context of climate change. The first option is to do nothing. That would be the equivalent of Doug Flutie taking a knee without even attempting to move the ball forward. The second option is to solely invest in climate adaptation, and effectively forfeit against the challenge of addressing climate change. This option would be the equivalent of Doug Flutie calling a run play in the final seconds of the game, essentially accepting the loss, but finishing out the game respectfully. The third and most exciting option is to throw our Hail Mary. This is the Green New Deal. A set of truly massive federally funded programs that drive our carbon emissions to net zero.

The phrase ‘massive federally funded programs’ is undoubtedly politically contentious as progressives and liberals will celebrate these new programs and fiscal conservatives will cringe at the thought of more taxes, more debt, more spending, and more government. Unfortunately, the reality of climate change is uncomfortable and requires our attention, our time, our dollars, and that of future generations as well. The planet is ours to maintain, and it isn’t cheap. There is of course a lot to be done by individuals, local governments, state governments, corporations, and non-governmental organizations. But, we have a time constraint that necessitates federal involvement in a big way.

When we refer to Green New Deal programs, we shouldn’t think of them as a single piece of legislation or a single bill being advocated for by one Congresswoman. We need to think about Green New Deal programs as a myriad of initiatives that will continue until we reach a steady-state net zero emission economy. This means that over the next 30–50 years, we are going to develop countless programs and initiatives designed to address climate change and reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. And then, after we achieve a net zero carbon footprint economy, we will have to maintain it. So, this means that many of these programs and initiatives will exist forever, and even more will have to be created for the specific purpose of maintaining the promise of a sustainable future.

Given the results of the 2020 Presidential Election in the United States, it is time for Americans to rally behind a Green New Deal… forever.

It is conceivable that the political pendulum in the United States will continue to swing back and forth, which means in 4 to 8 years, America might vote in a fiscal conservative that de-prioritizes addressing climate change. If that is a possible future, then it makes even more sense to support massive investments in Green New Deal programs now. Imagine spending 4 to 8 years passing incremental legislation and investing modest amounts of money in emissions reductions, and then shifting to fiscal conservative control of Congress and the White House in 2028 having only made small emissions reductions.

It is no longer reasonable to be fiscally conservative, because of the reality of climate change. If it is conceivable that America could elect a fiscally conservative Congress anytime in the future, then it is upon this new Congress and Administration to make any future Congress and Administration irrelevant in the fight to address climate change.

In other words, we don’t have the luxury of going back and forth anymore. The planet cannot withstand the long term impacts of the American political pendulum continuing to swing in and out of its favor. This new Congress and Administration must make the pursuit of a sustainable future permanent and disconnect that pursuit from the turmoil of politics. We need a Hail Mary play, not to win, but rather to just stay in the fight against climate change. We need that Hail Mary play to last a century, and we need it to work, which means we need some redundancy. Doug Flutie didn’t send one receiver down field. He sent three. We need to develop and deploy hundreds of programs and initiatives that address climate change, and send them off into the future with permanent and sufficient funding.",https://medium.com/predict/its-now-or-never-for-a-green-new-deal-9efad78a8530,Carbon Radio,2020-11-10 01:33:36.574000+00:00,"Environment,Future,Design,Sustainability,Climate Change"

Asking for help only means resolving problems faster! And time is the essence of the startup.

2. Finding emotional support

Lack of emotional support was what makes founders quit too soon.

Having a supportive community of like-minded fellow entrepreneurs helped many in restoring the motivation. It becomes important to see that you are not alone going through rough times and it’s a normal part of every startup journey.

In addition, every interviewed successful founder revealed that they had a special person with whom they could privately and openly vent about their complicated situations and their feelings.

However, that person was not just any person, it was a person would it be a friend, spouse, family member, mentor or coach who knew how to provide needed emotional safety and right kind of help.

3. Building a family

The most unexpected find from the interviews was that many founders mentioned how having family and children helped them to succeed in the startup life.

It is expected that founders would spend many nights in the office in building their startups. There is even a notion that if a founder that goes home at 7 pm is not serious about their venture’s success.

“Sometimes you feel guilty for not working as many hours as others while building a startup but at the same time having a family keeps everything that is happening in a startup world in perspective. Family and children remind you what is most important in life.”

This perspective helped founders in managing the mental sanity and make better decisions in the startup. Making time for family thought how to better structure days. Also, the family provided so needed emotional or even financial support during hard times in building a venture.

By talking to people you don’t let yourself be dragged down the hall of the spiraling negative thoughts and emotions. Expressing frustration of “what the fuck to do next” and having a chance to tell what you feel. Having a supportive family who does not put pressure on you keeps you balanced.

Lockdown and Chronic Depression are a Double Jeopardy,"The morning after the night before always hurts and I’m not sanguine about my chances of making it to the bathroom without vomiting on myself. Then again, I last had a meal two days ago. This is likely empty nausea, the kind you get after your brain took a beating because depression intensified. I’m teetotal but I still call this a vulnerability hangover, because those three days of despair were brutal.

And they got progressively worse.

I spend too many hours staring at the Dutch suicide prevention website and trying to work up the courage to launch the chat function. Eventually, I realize that if I’m not coherent enough to corral my distress into words in conversation at home or in print, chat will be useless. Besides, there are hardly any trains anymore; lying down on the track isn’t an option. Also, I’ve already eliminated the one pharmaceutical tool I could have used several weeks ago.

I may not have been very rational at the time but I also knew ingesting the whole lot would have been enough to knock me out or worse. I thought it more prudent to remove that possibility immediately before it became more attractive than it already was. To make sure it was gone for good, I took out the trash despite not looking remotely presentable.

"Federated Querying across Relational, Non-relational, Object, and Custom Data Sources using Amazon Athena","Querying Data from DynamoDB in Amazon Athena

Amazon Athena now enables users to run SQL queries across data stored in relational, non-relational, object, and custom data sources. With federated querying, customers can submit a single SQL query that scans data from multiple sources running on-premises or hosted in the cloud.

Athena executes federated queries using Athena Data Source Connectors that run on AWS Lambda. Athena federated query is available in Preview in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region.

Preparing to create federated queries is a two-part process:

Deploying a Lambda function data source connector. Connecting the Lambda function to a data source.

I assume that you have at least one DynamoDB table in us-east-1 region.

Deploy a Data Source Connector

Open the Amazon Athena console and choose the Connect data source. This feature is available in the region us-east-1 only.

On the Connect data source console, choose Query a data source feature. And choose Amazon DynamoDB as a data source.

Choose Next

For the Lambda function, choose to Configure new function . It opens in the Lambda console in a new tab with information about the connector.

. It opens in the Lambda console in a new tab with information about the connector. Under ApplicationSettings, provide the required information.

AthenaCatalogName — A name for the Lambda function. SpillBucket — An Amazon S3 bucket in your account to store data that exceeds Lambda function response size limits. SpillPrefix — Data that exceeds Lambda function response size limits stores under the Spillbucket/Spillprefix.

Choose I acknowledge that this app creates custom IAM roles and choose Deploy.

Connect to a data source using a connector that deployed in the earlier step

Open the Amazon Athena console and choose the Connect data source . This feature is available in the region us-east-1 only.

choose the name of the lambda that you created in the earlier step. Configure Catalog name, enter a unique name to use for the data source in your SQL queries, such as dynamo_athena.

Choose Connect. Now the data source is available under the Data Sources section in Amazon Athena.

Querying Data using Federated Queries

To use this feature in preview, you must create an Athena workgroup named AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality and join that workgroup.

Create an Athena workgroup

Open the Amazon Athena console and choose Workgroup, and choose Create workgroup.

After creating a Workgroup, under Workgroup section select the created workgroup and choose Switch workgroup.

Select the Data source that was created in the earlier step in Athena. After choosing the data source, the DynamoDb tables are available in Athena in the default database.

Querying Data in Athena using SQL Queries

The following query is used to retrieve data from DynamoDB in Athena.

SELECT * FROM ""data_source_connector"".""database_name"".""table_name"";

Creating Athena table using CTAS with results of querying DynamoDB

The CTAS query looks like the following. Using the CTAS query, the format of data can be changed into the required format be it parquet, JSON, and CSV, etc.

CREATE TABLE database.table_name

WITH (

external_location = 's3://bucket-name/data/',

format = 'parquet')

“Holy”: Jamila Woods’s HEAVN Finds Spiritual Freedom in Solitude,"Solitude has a stigma. Our society harshly judges a solo life in any capacity — from the simple decisions of attending a movie alone to the major life choices of not getting married. When we see people alone, we may think they are antisocial, defective, or even criminal in nature. This toxic judgement prevents us from deepening our relationship with ourselves and our brains. Without a sense of conviction in our solitude, we cannot be fully at peace with ourselves and our place in the world. It is only with a deeper sense of freedom in our solitary experiences that our relationships, goals, and health can fully blossom. Jamila Woods moves towards this solitude on “Holy”, the penultimate track off her outstanding debut album HEAVN, an angelic and stirring standout that highlights the human capacity to thrive within oneself.

“Holy” by Jamila Woods

Before leading fans to inspiration, Jamila Woods blew away audiences everywhere by shining the light on her own ability to thrive.

With immense lyrical depth and outstanding vocal performance, Jamila stole the show on 2015’s Surf, the debut album from The Social Experiment. On lead single “Sunday Candy”, she shocked and awed audiences with her angelic, tender, and rich voice, buoyed by lyrical content of spirituality and peace. On this gospel-infuenced hip-hop track, she delivered a chorus that could make the clouds part and the sun shine down even on the darkest days. Riding the waves of that critical and commercial success, she released 2016’s HEAVN — capitalizing on her vocal strengths while expanding her lyrical content towards topics like racial identity, gender politics, hometown reflections, and internal purpose.

Through these topics, Jamila never stops searching for her own personal heaven.

“Give me today my daily bread / Help me to walk alone ahead / Though I walk through the darkest valley I will fear no love / Oh my smile my mind reassure me I don’t need no one”

Jamila opens the song with a steady and passionate vocal delivery that immediately absorbs you into the heady atmosphere of the track. She punctuates each word with an ever-so-slight staccato that perfectly lands in sync with the drum beat. This contrasting combination allows the gravity of each word to sink in while maintaining a comforting levity throughout the track. That levity allows us to maintain hope as Jamila recounts the rollercoaster of feelings that comes with our lease on life.

With references to Christian theology, she acknowledges that the expedition of life is often one that is both solitary and spiritual. In this expedition, we will trek though the darkest valleys. Trying to do this without a flashlight, guidebook, or a crew can be one of the most terrifying undertakings. Yet when we remember that we always have ourselves for support through the ebbs and flows, a conviction so powerful begins to overtake us.

With a new conviction, often comes an epiphany.

“Woke up this morning with my mind set on loving me / With my mind set on loving me / I’m not lonely, I’m alone / And I’m holy by my own”

With a simple but enlightening chorus, Jamila shifts the connotations of being alone that have been ingrained in so many of us. We can be surrounded by tons of people but still feel empty and lonely, and we can be all by ourselves yet brim with fulfillment. As we create more of the latter moments for ourselves, we make the sacred transition from loneliness to solitude.

The electronic-tinged synth loops, jazz-influenced drum pattern, and soothing horns all build in a slow-moving fashion allowing for a steady energy that grows fuller as the song progresses with Jamila’s journey. This instrumentation coupled with her heavenly and seasoned vocals, create an environment that is just as internally convicted as it is externally triumphant.

This triumph is not without the acknowledgement of life’s hard truths.

“Ye, the bad days may come / The lover may leave / The winter may not / Hey, the map of your palms / The temple you be / You’re all that you got”

With these words and her mature-sounding vocal delivery, Jamila gives an impression of someone who has seen pain and hardship directly in the face but has maintained a level of practical determination to not wither in the storms of life. As the horns crescendo and an injection of soulful crooning supports Jamila’s final chorus, her determination transfers to the listening audience. We leave the song understanding that life is hard, but we begin to internalize the idea that our capacity to thrive in times of solitary strife may have been severely underrated.

As college has come and gone, and I have moved to a major city, this stage of my life has naturally veered into a more solitary direction. I still see and connect with friends, family, and co-workers on a highly regular basis, but I also have begun to spend much more time alone. Even more jarring than that, my life path has become much more of a solo endeavor. The intense camaraderie that defined my life has disappeared as I am no longer in the same structural bubble of the American education system.

This change was difficult at first. What begun as a pretty intense bout of loneliness slowly transformed into a great focus on myself. I began to take much better care of my mental and physical health, creating a more disciplined food, sleep, and exercise routine, along with taking full advantage of my company’s free mental healthcare benefits. I started my music publication, which deeply reconnected me with my core values and made me profoundly optimistic of where I could take my dreams. All these changes skyrocketed my ability to be self-compassionate and deepened in me a strong sense of self-efficacy.

These types of transformative experiences crystalize in the moments we spend with ourselves. These are times when we can ponder, reflect, and process our lives completely without distraction or input. Eventually, this time of disconnection can lead us to a place where our greatest values and hopes are no longer this drifting ephemeral cloud that is impossible to grasp, but a burning spiritual fire that is at the forefront of our consciousness. While crippling and painful at first, this solitude eventually builds us in ways we could have never imagined.

In this solitude, we find our freedom.",https://medium.com/beats-and-thoughts/holy-jamila-woodss-heavn-standout-finds-spiritual-freedom-in-solitude-ae9a09cc38d7,Mohith Subbarao,2020-01-30 04:44:49.946000+00:00,"Music,Mental Health,Psychology,Analysis,Art"
How Google and Its Geeks Nudge Each Other to Sustainability,"When you think of working at Google, what likely comes to mind are the legendary perks, the game rooms, free haircuts, and napping pods. But while the Silicon Valley titan has earned a reputation as a leader in corporate sustainability, less evident is its use of certain perks to encourage employees to reduce their own environmental footprints. Likewise, sometimes the supersmart “Googlers” are the ones pushing the green envelope.

Google’s sustainability cred comes in part from its status as the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, not counting utilities. Since 2010, the company has signed 20 agreements to purchase roughly 2.6 gigawatts, about the same as taking 1.2 million cars off the road.

Google is also on track to reach its goal of using 100 percent clean power across its operations this year. To be clear, this does not mean that the company will run entirely on wind and solar, but that Google will purchase renewable electricity each year equal to the amount of electricity its global operations consume.

But clean energy is only part of the picture. The company has numerous energy efficiency and waste reduction initiatives at its offices and data centers, which save money while reducing environmental impact.

Because we’re talking about Google, these efforts often involve the use of various digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (more on that in a bit), to solve problems. For example, while Google provides compost bins in its famous cafés where employees chow down on free gourmet meals, its chefs use digital scales designed by a company called LeanPath to monitor supply and usage in the kitchen to improve meal planning and reduce waste in the preparation process.

The company thinks about waste in a “broader framework” and is trying “to design waste out of our systems altogether,” says Kate Brandt, chief sustainability officer at Google. “It certainly has some parallels with energy efficiency — there’s a great business case for it as well a great environmental benefits.”

Through its waste reduction, composting, and reuse and recycling programs, Google has reached an 86 percent landfill diversion rate at its Bay Area offices and 78 percent globally. This year, the goal is another 10 percent reduction per Bay Area employee compared with 2015, as well as a new set of regional targets.

Bikes and Burgers

Food is one of two areas where perks at Google overlap with incentivizing employees to shrink their environmental footprint. The other is transportation.

First, workers must commute to the compounds where they infamously spend much of their time. The company’s shuttles, which run on 5 percent biofuel and include heavy-duty filtration systems, have been a fixture on Bay Area highways for a decade now.

In 2015, use of Google shuttles and the more recently added corporate electric vehicles netted an annual savings of 29,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, the equivalent of taking 5,700 cars off the road. Globally, the company has installed more than 1,600 electric vehicle charging ports at its offices and data centers, and employees can charge their cars at work for free.

The company also gives an electric pedal-assist bike, lock, and helmet to any employee at its Silicon Valley headquarters who wants to make biking his or her primary means of commuting.

The overall goal: to reduce single-occupancy vehicle commuting at the headquarters to 45 percent by transitioning more workers to shuttles, carpooling, public transit, biking, and walking. (Google does not prohibit working from home, but neither does it particularly promote it.)

Meanwhile, back at the company’s cafés, you’ll find more covert attempts at changing employee lifestyle. For example, Google is subtly nudging its workers toward a less meat-intensive diet, according to a recent report by Fast Company. Meat consumption contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions — by one estimate, raising livestock for meat, dairy, and eggs is responsible for 14.5 percent of emissions globally.

Google’s chefs prepare various vegan dishes — often made with “ugly produce” bought at a discount and saved from the landfill — but the company doesn’t try to convert meat lovers immediately to a fully vegetarian diet. Instead, its strategy is to reduce meat consumption, such as with its “blended” burger that uses mushrooms to cut the amount of beef in each patty.

Now here’s the covert part: Over time, the company has slowly increased the percentage of mushrooms, which add moisture and soak up the flavor of the beef as they cook, in each burger from 20 percent to 50 percent. In other dishes, meat might shift from being the center of the meal to a side or garnish.

Geeking Out on Energy Efficient Data Centers

Google corporate doesn’t always do the nudging. It has an incredibly talented staff coming up with new ideas during each lap in the onsite pool.

Brandt tells the story of Jim Gao, a former Google efficiency engineer who last year made it his mission to use artificial intelligence to reduce energy use at the company’s data centers, which as of 2015 already used 50 percent less energy than the industry average.

You probably don’t think about it every time you send an email, comment on a social media post, or watch the latest YouTube clip, but it takes a network of enormous energy-consuming data centers to keep the internet humming 24/7. This connectivity, like everything, comes at a cost.

Globally, data centers consume 3 percent of the world’s energy (around 420 terawatts) and emit 2 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases, according to Yole Développement, a French market research and consulting company focused on the technology industry. Google has 14 data centers around the world and has long considered its servers to be the front line of its sustainability efforts.

Gao did his work via a 20% Project, a company program that allows employees to use 20 percent of their time at work to solve a particular problem. He had taken a class in machine learning, a type of AI that gives computers the ability to learn things without being explicitly programmed. Basically, computers can teach themselves through repetition how to interpret large amounts of data.

Google was already using machine learning to improve features like language translation and image recognition. When you ask Google Photos for pictures of cats in a box, Google’s machine learning algorithms find the photos you want. So Goa wondered: Why not use this tech to reduce server energy use?

He soon discovered why not. With all of the different variables, Goa and his data center intelligence team were looking at billions of distinct configurations, a set of possibilities far beyond the ability of any human to test. So Goa joined forces with Google’s leading AI research group, DeepMind, which had recently gained attention for its work on a computer agent that taught itself to play not just one, but every Atari game really well. (Goa now works for DeepMind full-time.)

Goa’s team and DeepMind used a model of broader, more generalized algorithms and came up with a solution: General beats specific. Since their discovery, the models have been piloted at multiple data centers and have produced a 40 percent reduction in energy used for cooling and a 15 percent reduction in overall energy overhead.

Goa is far from an anomaly. “Not a week goes by that I’m not talking to someone about a new idea or a potential 20% project,” says Brandt.

Google’s monstrous volume of servers has also become an example of deploying what’s called the “circular economy” at scale, says Brandt. The circular economy is the buzzword for the latest incarnation of waste reduction, which involves designing more efficient systems (or products or equipment) where materials are endlessly cycled back through via repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling. (Remember the LeanPath scale? That’s an example of designing waste out of a system.)

Google starts with server maintenance so equipment can be used as long as possible. Servers that can’t be kept on the floor get pulled off and sent to a central hub for remanufacturing. Functioning parts that the company no longer needs, such as hard drives, are wiped clean and sold on the secondary market. Anything left over gets recycled through the company’s recycling partners.

Last year, the company diverted 86 percent of its data center waste away from landfills. As of September, Google’s goal is zero waste to landfills at all 14 of its locations.

“We definitely set a stretch goal to reach zero waste to landfill, but this is the kind of challenge we get excited about,” says Brandt. “We like to solve these gnarly problems.”

J.K. Rowling’s Advice For Writers With Big Dreams,"J.K. Rowling’s Advice For Writers With Big Dreams

A simple and highly effective way to up your game

Photo by Rae Tian on Unsplash

J.K. Rowling is the richest writer in the world.

Making a fortune on children’s book seems impossible. But it happened for her, and it happened again and again.

As legend has it, Harry Potter came to her when she was riding a train. She started writing as soon as she got home.

You never know where and when a great idea will present itself to you.

Write them all down when they show up. Take time to flesh them out and lead you in new directions.

That’s where great writing starts.

But if you really want to be the best writer you can be, you’ve got to do one simple thing repeatedly.

Write the Rubbish Out

Rowling is British. I’m using her word for verbal garbage here.

You get good at anything by being bad at it first.

The first time you drive a car, you better practice in a wide open space like an empty parking lot while school’s out. This is smart because you won’t hit another car with yours while you’re learning how hard to press the gas and hit the brake. You won’t annoy the people behind because nobody is behind you. Do this enough and by the time you hit the road, no one has to fear for their life.

If you’re a parent, you know kids are born with foolishness built in. Your job is to drive it out of them so they navigate life well and stay out of constant trouble.

It’s not easy. But if you don’t do it, you’ll pay dearly for it later.

When you first start writing from a raw idea, it might not make much sense. That’s okay. Just like bodybuilders have to warm up their muscles before they pump iron, writers have to warm up their pens a bit before the words flow with ease and elegance.

You can’t skip this step if you want to be a great writer.

And don’t worry, you don’t have to share the rubbish.

The next point will sound counter to that, but trust me, it isn’t.

Share your failures

Do you want to be perfect?

I understand. I want to be perfect, too. And I’ve tried really hard.

I can’t do it.

Perfection is at best, elusive and subjective.

It’s elusive because you can always look at your work tomorrow and say, “I could have done that better.”

Don’t torture yourself.

All great art isn’t perfect. It’s finished. The artist stopped somewhere. You must too, if you want to publish and ship regularly.

Perfect is subjective because one person’s awesome is another one’s awful. Want to please everyone? You can’t. Please the ones who care about what you care about.

So show us your flaws. Share your failures. We know you’re not thrilled about them. But that one bad experience, framed the right way, can bring someone the hope they’ve been longing for.

Can you think of a better gift than that?

We can’t relate to people with perfect lives. We love those who succeed despite the fact they’re as messed up as we are.

So go ahead, share that mess.

Choose the right goal

We’ve kicked perfection to the curb.

What do we have left to focus on?

Effectiveness.

How can you leave someone better than you found them?

How can your story give hope to others who struggle?

How deep can you dig to show that you care and that it’s okay to be messed up?

Honest writers make the best connections with readers.

Am I telling you not to aim high?

No way.

Compete with who you were yesterday. It’s the only fair contest. Define your mission so clearly you know what it will take to achieve it. Consider each post to be part of a body of work dedicated to that mission.

Each time you write your heart out you move one step closer to achieving your mission.

It all starts when you embrace the rubbish within. Write it out and you’ll find the gold.",https://medium.com/swlh/j-k-rowlings-advice-for-writers-with-big-dreams-b5ea306baf7c,Frank Mckinley,2019-12-27 21:31:04.838000+00:00,"Success,Creativity,Entrepreneurship,Productivity,Writing"
F. Scott Fitzgerald on How to Write Masterful Dialogue,"September 22 marked the beginning of autumn, and it reminded me of this wonderful quote from The Great Gatsby,

“Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”

As the quote repeated itself in my brain, I wondered what part of the book it came from. There are so many quotes like this one that people lift from books and share across Instagram and other social media sites, devoid of their original context.

So I went in search of the quote and found it on page 107 of my edition of The Great Gatsby. It’s a line of dialogue that the character Jordan says in reply to Gatsby’s love interest, Daisy:

‘What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon,’ cried Daisy, ‘and the day after that, and the next thirty years?’ ‘Don’t be morbid,’ Jordan said. ‘Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.’

The writer in me sprang to attention and said, “What masterfully written dialogue!”

Perhaps I could glean several tips from Fitzgerald that would help me to write masterful dialogue as well.

So I continued reading a little more of the scene and came away with these three takeaways.

1. Increase Conflict Through Contradiction

Conflict makes a story a story. If The Great Gatsby were just about Nick Carraway’s stay in a cottage in New York and described his rather monotonous daily routine, the book would not have become a bestseller. Instead, the book is full of shocking plot twists: murders, affairs, and more.

Just as conflict drives the plot of a story forward, it drives dialogue forward as well.

Notice in the lines of dialogue above that Jordan is reproving Daisy. This adds tension to the conversation and also introduces the unexpected, which keeps readers on their toes.

Each of your characters should have their own unique personalities. This means they’ll probably disagree with each other more often than they would agree.

I delved into this more in the YouTube video I recently made about the dinner table exercise. You can watch it here.

How to Put This Tip Into Action: I’ve found this tip very helpful for editing the novel I recently finished writing. I’d written several scenes with long conversations, and I realized they weren’t very interesting because it was just one character speaking their mind. I introduced disagreement and questioning from other characters, and the conversations became much more interesting to read and revealed much more about the characters’ personalities.

As you write a conversation in your story or novel, experiment with having characters disagree with each other. You might find that the conversation ends up going in a different direction than you had originally intended and makes your plot even more intriguing.

2. Avoid Writing Dialogue That’s “On the Nose”

As I continued reading the scene from The Great Gatsby, I realized that it was the part of the story where Daisy accidently reveals she loves Gatsby in front of her husband, Tom. Here’s what Fitzgerald writes,

‘Who wants to go to town?’ demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. ‘Ah,’ she cried, ‘you look so cool.’ Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table. ‘You always look so cool,’ she repeated. She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded.

Notice that Daisy doesn’t say out loud to Gatsby that she loves him. Instead, she merely says that he looks cool. Fitzgerald explains that the underlying subtext is that she loves Gatsby. The subtlety of her words makes the scene compelling.

This is a fantastic reminder not to write dialogue that is “on the nose.” Try to avoid having your characters say something that’s obvious to the reader or reveals exactly what the character is feeling or thinking with no subtext.

How To Put This Tip Into Action: Take a story or other manuscript you’ve written and see if there is any “on the nose” dialogue. Rewrite it to make the scene more engaging for your readers. Instead of having a character exclaim, “I’m angry!” show us the character is angry through their actions and facial expressions and through a more subtle line of dialogue.

A quick note, though, that “on the nose” dialogue isn’t always a no-no. A demure, soft-spoken old lady who suddenly lashes out and exclaims, “I’m furious!” will pique your readers’ curiosity.

So only avoid “on the nose” dialogue if it is stating something obvious or if it is not revealing further details about the character’s personality.

3. Hint at the Theme of Your Story

Here are two more fantastic lines of dialogue from this scene:

‘She’s got an indiscreet voice,’ I remarked. ‘It’s full of — ‘

I hesitated. ‘Her voice is full of money,’ he said suddenly. That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money — that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it….

Fitzgerald uses the line of dialogue “Her voice is full of money” to hint at one of the themes of the story: the shallowness of the upper class, who hide behind their wealth.

In his book Storycraft, editor Jack Hart notes the importance of having a theme or lesson in your piece of writing,

“Theme gives the audience a sense of time well invested. (What’s the point of reading unless reading has a point?)…When you think about it, every theme incorporates a lesson. That’s the value added that draws an audience to a story in the first place. The bigger the lesson, the more value added. The biggest have the enduring quality we associate with great literature.”

You can convey your story’s theme in a lot of different ways: character arcs, plot structure, etc. And, as we see in The Great Gatsby, you can also convey the theme through dialogue.

How To Put This Tip Into Action: When you attempt to convey a theme through dialogue, it’s easy to fall into the trap of having a character preach at the reader for several long paragraphs. Fitzgerald shows how to convey a theme with just a single sentence of dialogue.

Look at a piece you’ve written and see if you have any characters (maybe even the narrator) preaching at the readers. See if you can simplify what they’re saying into just one memorable line or two. Conversely, if you have a piece where you haven’t conveyed the theme as strongly as you’d like, see if you can work it in through a line of dialogue.

The Takeaway

I’m sure if we continued studying Fitzgerald’s novel we could glean many more tips for how to write memorable dialogue, but these three are a fantastic starting point.

How we helped streamline a mobile solutions company’s processes in a business-friendly way,"Mesensei is a company that designs and creates mobile solutions for organisations and companies. The company turned to Kodan when they wanted to renew some of their software development processes and make them more effective, productive and cost-effective. After some brainstorming, we decided to focus on transforming part of their service into the cloud. The result of teaming up with Mesensei was a modern new way of working that Mesensei can now carry out independently in their future projects.

The project: Designing new architecture to streamline product development

We were excited to be asked by Mesensei to kick their product into a new gear and speed up their development by offering technical help. We wanted to design the new architecture in a way that would support and enhance the company’s business model. Transforming the process was a challenge, but we here at Kodan love a good challenge!

Moving to the cloud for flexibility and safety

At the start of the project, we felt the vibe about where Mesensei was at and then had a brainstorming sessions to chat about where they wanted to go next. Deciding to split the system into several smaller parts and moving those into a cloud infrastructure, we used the microservice architecture approach, because operating in the cloud improves system performance and safety, and makes everything easier to maintain.

We chose the Mesensei’s API for images as our test feature that we would move into the cloud. As the projectt kicked off, we noticed we could also offer Mesensei valuable help with programming and provide them with more workforce.

Kicking off with the modernization at the beginning of 2019, we used AWS and node.js tools and brought in a senior and a junior coder, which also helped us amp up our own knowledge. While our developers Nikolas, Juho and Jan worked with moving the image API into the cloud, Mesensei’s programmers were able to get on with their own work, using the existing system uninterrupted.

Result: Cloud-based microarchitecture, clear direction and more tools for the future

The project didn’t need a hefty investment in terms of money or time. All in all, it was a swift move that will help Mesensei to do the same with the rest of their services in the future, and in general enables new, established processes. New features can now be developed and implemented faster than ever.

At the end of our collaboration, Mesensei was happy with the work we’d done together and the smoothness of the process. We’re stoked to have helped them on their journey toward expansion.

“Working with Kodan has been a breeze. They were quick and efficient, and we got solid and concrete results fast.” - Tuukka Ylälahti, Co-founder & CEO at Mesensei

How are Big Tech Companies Dominating the Markets in the Global Arena?,"Our focus today will be on big tech companies. Let’s take, for example, Amazon, Apple, etc.,

Amazon

Let’s say, for example, it is called as the gatekeeper of e-commerce. It reduces the competition and harms the consumers and people who are not putting their products on this particular platform. Let’s say, for example, Amazon has a huge amount of money in its kitty. It decimates the brick and mortar stores and it makes sure that it is collecting all the data of a particular customer. This also pushes a product to the customer such that his data and privacy are also compromised. So Amazon being too big and has a huge market dominance has become impossible for other companies to dominate over Amazon.

Apple

Apart from this, when it comes to Apple. Apple also favors its own applications. It also puts rivals at a disadvantage as well, and when it comes to Apple and Google, they are on a buying spree as well. Whenever they see a competition that is popping up against the hegemony of these companies, they immediately buy that particular company rather than competing with them. Instagram and WhatsApp could have become the competitors of Facebook, but since they saw that they could not compete with Instagram, they immediately grab an opportunity to buy that specific company; the same is with Apple and Google.

When it comes to Google, it buys at least one firm a month, and when it comes to Apple, it buys two to three firms every single month, says statistics.

So what would be the impact?

When it comes to the impact, the consumers or the customers who have been availing their services will have limited opportunities. Since they have limited opportunities, they will not have multiple options as well. This ultimately means that they have to go buy that particular service only from big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, or in fact, Facebook as well. And as a result, what will happen? The consumer base will also start increasing only with respect to those big tech companies. So what will happen? We are giving away our data, and this particular data, when it is given, can be violated, which will violate the right to privacy. Initially, when Facebook had come, initially when there was Google as well, all these people used to respect the right to privacy with eventuality when there is no competition.

They also take up our data and manipulate our data because data is the new fuel for Facebook and Google. So what do they do? They target our inboxes with what is called as the advertisement with which we attempted to buy a particular product as well. They also understand what our political inclinations are, and they also play a political role as well. Such is the devastation that they cause when it comes to the consumers.

Now when it comes to India. Let’s look at some of the statistics. More than 400 million of Whatsapp’s estimated two billion users are in India. Amazon has around one-third of the share of online retail in India, neck to neck with Flipkart, which was recently acquired by Wal-Mart. Then we have India as Facebook’s largest single market with around 270 million accounts. Google completely dominates the search engine space in India. Most smartphones in India are also Android-based OS.

Since they are dominating in India, this article suggests that for the Competition Commission of India and elsewhere in their own countries for more regulation. When it comes to countries in Europe and the United States of America, they are also planning to break companies as well. One such suggestion was given by the federal agency in the United States of America. Back in the 1980s, we have AT&T, which had also gone too huge when it comes to its market. So what was decided by the federal agency back then? They had to break this AT&T and split this particular organization.

Similarly, they are also planning a proposal with respect to Facebook as well. The split will be Facebook as an independent organization. We will also have Instagram as an independent organization or an application and WhatsApp as an independent application. So this is a suggestion given by the federal agency. So they do not have all the hold in the market, and there are diversification and more options given to the customers as well. This is one of the proposals given by the federal agency and also in European countries as well.

Also, remember, when it comes to companies like Facebook or Google, they have a cozy relationship with political parties in India as well. So what we require is more regulations, more laws to control the dominance of the big tech firms. And at the same time, India does not have a privacy law. So when it comes up with privacy law, they have to make sure all these aspects of data collection are taken into the picture when a law is being drafted.

‘Am I Just Lazy?’,"We’ve got an obsession with productivity. “Hacks” for life are everywhere, covering every aspect of human existence. We can hack relationships, jobs, household tasks, and more. So many of us are obsessed with efficiency in our own private sphere. Our never ending search for peak productivity becomes a whole distraction from productivity in and of itself…

So what is the answer then, for that person who doesn’t move at the same pace? For whom doing anything seems to be hard? Who never seems motivated or interested in anything?

When I started grappling with my own mental health, I remember becoming distinctly aware of the notion that one should just “buck up”, and get on with things — that that was the only “real” way out of depression. “Just do more stuff,” came the advice. Perhaps this is the obvious argument in a world where we are all driven to do more, when we see someone who doesn’t seem driven anywhere. “Doing more” seems like the obvious counter. That absolutely does not work for someone who is depressed; having commitments, activities and routine can certainly help prevent depression and keep things moving. But in a low, just pummelling yourself with the guilt associated with not doing anything will really do very little for you. So is that person being lazy, or are they actually depressed?

Mental health is such a complex issue, and I have written many times about depression and how to handle it. The only possible way I have noticed that we can differentiate between laziness and an actual problem comes when that person is out of the worst part of the cycle. Most people I know with depression aren’t content to keep on suffering — in my opinion, it’s pretty hard to be okay with being depressed. Obviously they’re unhappy — low moods are part of depression — but they also want to know that there’s another option and much of the time, unless they are really truly in the lowest part of the cycle, they want potentially to work towards a better place. At the lowest point, this isn’t something that can even be imagined. If someone is suicidal, they aren’t thinking about changing their depression, they’re thinking about what would give relief, most quickly. Because depression is painful.

Laziness, on the other hand, is something else entirely. And the lazy person doesn’t really seem to mind quite so much — it isn’t painful to them to be that way. It’s easy. And easy is what they’re going for.

So, firstly: engage in some direct self reflection

It’s pretty hard to outwardly tell the difference sometimes between laziness and depression, even for ourselves. Only you, as an individual, can ask yourself for the truth and face your own reality. Are you dealing with a mental health problem, or have you always shown a tendency towards laziness? Most people don’t become lazy overnight. So think back: how likely were you to finish things in school? Or keep up hobbies? How often do you see projects or ideas through to completion, or keep on working at something until you feel you’ve achieved something tangible? Are you looking for the first opportunity to shift into a new shiny activity? Or are you always picking up new hobbies? Are you someone who leaves things unfinished?

If none of this sounds like you but lately things have been getting darker, harder to deal with, and the world seems a bit more grey than it should, you might well be experiencing low mood and potentially even depression. In which case, you need to start by understanding that, and how to take care of yourself in that mode.

Set the baseline and break it down into achievable parts

We’ve all got to eat healthy, exercise and sleep, in order to have the energy to do things we want or need to do. So it’s time to set the baseline: when should you be getting into bed each night? How can you ensure that you do that? Do you need to create a nighttime routine? What about in the morning? I’m personally quite a light sleeper, so one alarm and I’m up. But you need to learn how to make mornings work for you. That doesn’t mean cramming in an entire second life before work, the way many productivity blogs advise. I personally do do that, I’ll be honest; but I love mornings. If you are not a morning person, then work with it, not against it.

Consider taking up meditation. Find a type of exercise that works for you, that you actually enjoy. Take these things one step at a time and practice some self-compassion as you experiment. Take note of what works, and what definitely doesn’t work — literally write it down.

Figure out where your focus should be

Values. They’re everything. I wrote about this recently, because I think the process of figuring out your core values is really important. Often laziness comes from an inability to focus on what you need to do — things feel overwhelming perhaps, or there’s so much to get done that you feel paralysed. But taking a breath and a step back is really important. Figure out what should be holding your attention — where your values truly lie. From here, there’s a much better chance you will be able to get moving again. It’s the fog of laziness and an inability to prioritise that can become easy stopping points.

It’s time: Face your fears

Sometimes ‘laziness’ is actually just ‘fear’ in disguise. Like, you’re afraid to commit to doing something you might fail at.

I know what that’s like. Intimately. And living that way isn’t great. It’s a pretty good way to subject yourself to constant unease and guilt. Because ultimately only we can decide to bite the bullet and commit to doing the thing that scares us most. And if it’s living life the way you really want to, it comes down to this:

Will you be okay to die wondering? Ultimately, what will my life look like, when I look back on it? The idea that I might get old and die without having ever tried was more terrifying than any of my objections — than any other fear my mind could conjure up. I needed to write. I needed to try and to know my own currency.

So…

Do one thing first

Just one thing that will move you in the direction of your values. Making the conscious effort to stop sitting around or finding excuses to do whatever is easiest is going to be the tough first step. Put down the game, stop Instagramming, don’t text gifs to your friends. Just think: what is it I want to be doing with my life? What are my values? And what one thing can I do to enact them? Even if it is starting with making a list. Just start.",https://christinacare.medium.com/am-i-just-lazy-bb45878cd0e9,Christina Hope,2018-12-10 17:10:03.168000+00:00,"Mental Health,Motivation,Psychology,Depression,Productivity"
"Walk, Scrub, Shower!","“We must actively, consciously, consistently, and creatively nurture our artist selves.”

― Julia Cameron, The Artist’s Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity

Are you like me? You get some of your very best ideas in the shower. You swear you will remember them — they’re that good. And then you get busy with life. Finally, you settle down to capture your brainstorm. Maybe it’s a catchy headline or blogging topic. But you draw a blank. Where the F- did it go?

According to Julia Cameron, author of The Artist’s Way, and others who study such things, when we’re doing repetitive actions that don’t require a lot of concentration, like walking, washing dishes, showering, gardening, etc., our brain is relaxed and free to roam.

Neuroscientists who study the brain have found that exercise not only strengthens muscles and other body functions, but it generates new neurons and neural connections in the brain. Athlete and coach Christopher Bergland interviewed scientists on this topic for Psychology Today:

Although there is some controversy and debate on the best ways to improve fluid intelligence, common sense would suggest that non-academic pursuits — including aerobic exercise — are key to improving not only cognition but someone’s long-term success in life. I have written a wide range of Psychology Today blog posts that link — physical activity, playing a musical instrument, making art, improving motor skills, and getting a good night’s sleep — with optimizing brain function and improving cognitive abilities.

Here’s my over-simplified take on it: When our brain is not needed for a specific task, it’s free to roam. Anywhere — through the fields of memories, scanning and reviewing some of the over-stimulating content it’s been fed non-stop with no time to process: snippets from ads, phone calls, videos, Twitter, etc.

Our brains love to make connections and solve puzzles.

What if? is a great question for a brain — harvesting the fruit of those new neural connections. What if this character from this book met up with that character from that book? (Great idea, but make sure the characters are in public domain first!!!)

And brainstorming! Our brains love to make lists. I do this on my Iphone’s microphone feature while out on my nightly sunset walk.

Talking into my Notes app, I’ll brainstorm headlines for possible articles — the more ridiculous, the better, as that gets the juices flowing. This is how I do my pitch idea homework for my satire class. (Yes, while a lot of it comes naturally, taking a class from Second City sure helps me develop whatever gifts I may have in this area!)

Or topics for articles and book ideas for BYOB — Blog your own Book. Or who to reach out to for such and such. Or even a to-do list I hadn’t time to write yet.

Get into your groove.

My theory is it’s the rhythm of these activities that make them so productive. Swimming is one that helped me solve plot glitches. Cameron recommends it as well as the more meditative knitting, for that reason among others.

Once when I was stuck with a plotting quandary in my novel, a solution popped into my head absolutely unbidden while swimming laps at the Y. I was trying to get my hero’s wife to do his dirty work, and she wasn’t having it.

The a-ha came when his youngest son popped into my head while doing the crawl. Perfect foil. Too young to know any better. Meanwhile, forcing my brain to come up with a solution usually doesn’t work. When I try that, the ole gray matter likes to rebel!

Bergland also validates these experiences in Psychology Today:

Most often, creative solutions are not wrestled from your mind through sheer force of will. Eureka moments tend to occur spontaneously, almost always when the conscious mind is thinking of something else, or nothing at all.

Build some of these activities into your day.

Because you need a clean house or at least a clean kitchen. Because you need a clean body. And a healthy one. And you need a break from the left brain non-stop push, push, push.

It’s your health and sanity, and creative input all rolled into one. But don’t stress or force it. Be relaxed. Take deep breaths, allow it to come. Put on your dictaphone, and just start talking, like how morning pages work.

Sooner or later, the ideas just come. Welcome them and corral them. Don’t judge; you never know when it will prove just the perfect fit. As Kevin Costner was told in the film Field of Dreams, “Build it, and they will come!”

Write for Towards Data Science,"Guidelines

How to get your article ready for publication!

We aim to strike a balance between innovating, informing and philosophizing. We want to hear from you! But we do ask that if you are not a professional writer, you consider the following points when you prepare your article. We want to publish high quality, professional articles that people want to read.

Please be aware that if you don’t follow our submission guidelines, your article won’t be accepted.

1. Is your story a story that needs to be told?

Before you start writing, ask yourself: is this story a story that needs to be told?

If you have read many articles addressing the same issue or explaining the same concept, think twice before writing another one. If you have a radical, new take on an old chestnut, we want to hear from you… but, we need you to persuade us that your article is something special that distinguishes itself from the pack and speaks to our audience.

Conversely, if your article addresses an underserved area or presents a new idea or method, that’s just what we are after!

2. What is your message?

Let us know what your ‘take home message’ is, right from the start. Give your piece a snappy introduction that tells us:

What is your novel idea?

Why should we care?

How are you going to prove your point?

Once you’ve got that out of the way, you can be as conversational as you like, but keep calling back to the central message and give us a solid conclusion.

Remember though, Towards Data Science is not your personal blog, keep it sharp and on-topic!

3. On the internet, nobody knows you are a dog

You’ve got a new idea or a new way of doing things, you want to tell the community and start a discussion. Fantastic, that’s what we want too, but we’re not going to take for granted that you know what you are talking about or that we should uncritically believe what you say… you’ve got to persuade us (your audience) that:

The subject matter is important

There is a gap that needs to be filled

You have the answer

Your solution works

Your idea is based on a logical progression of ideas and evidence

If you are giving us a tutorial, tell us why people would need to use this tool and why your way is better than the methods already published.

You can do this by explaining the background, showing examples, providing an experiment or just laying out how data you have extracted from various sources allowed you to synthesise this new idea.

Are there arguments that counter your opinion or your findings? Explain why that interpretation conflicts with your idea and why your idea comes out on top.

4. Do you have a short title with an insightful subtitle?

If you scroll up to the top of this page, you will see an example of a title and subtitle. Your post needs to have a short title and a longer subtitle that tell readers what your article is about or why they should read it. Your header is useful for attracting potential readers and making your intentions clear. To remain consistent and give readers the best experience possible, we do not allow titles or subtitles written in all-caps. We also ask that you avoid profanity in both your title and subtitle.

When your subtitle is directly under the title and formatted correctly, it will show up in some post previews, which helps with your click-through rate. To correctly format your subtitle on Medium, type it out, highlight the text and then click the smaller of the two Ts in the popup window.

5. What value do you deliver to your readers?

Make sure your post achieves its purpose. For instance, if your goal is to explain several concepts, ensure that these concepts are bared to their essentials, narrated in an orderly sequence and illustrated with simple and accurate analogies.

Second, use concrete language and visual imagery. As Steven Pinker puts it in his book The Sense of Style: “We are primates, with a third of our brains dedicated to vision, and large swaths devoted to touch, hearing, motion, and space. For us to go from “I think I understand” to “I understand,” we need to see the sights and feel the motions.” and he continues “Many experiments have shown that readers understand and remember material far better when it is expressed in concrete language that allows them to form visual images”.

Third, work to improve your writing skills. You could start by replacing linking and light verbs such as ‘to be, is, going, become, bring, make, take, have’, by more precise action verbs. For example, you could say ‘agile’ instead of ‘going fast’. There is plenty of great advice on the internet.

Finally, check for spelling, punctuation and grammatical mistakes. If you can’t do it yourself, use Grammarly and then ask a friend to help you. As we are such a small team, we can’t correct every submission.

6. Is your code well displayed?

Please don’t screenshot your code but use one of these two other solutions:

Medium’s native code blocks & inline code

Embed GitHub gists

If you paste a code within your article, be sure to explain it so all your readers can follow what you are doing.

7. Check your facts

Whenever you provide a fact, if it’s not self-evident, let us know where you learned it. Tell us who your sources are and where your data originated. If we want to have a conversation we all need to be on the same page. Maybe something you say will spark a discussion, but if we want to be sure we are not at cross purposes, we need to go back to the original and read for ourselves in case we are missing a vital piece of the puzzle that makes everything you say make sense.

8. Is your conclusion to the point and not promotional?

Please make sure that you include a conclusion at the end of your article. It’s a great way to help your readers review and remember the essential points or ideas you’ve covered. You can also use your conclusion to link an original post or a few relevant articles.

Please do not request claps and donations and don’t include more than three links to previously published articles. Readers know that they can click on your profile to see all your posts and they know that they can follow you, so there is no need to request it.

For your references, please respect this format:

[X] N. Name, Title (Year), Source

For example, your first reference should look like this:

[1] A. Pesah, A. Wehenkel and G. Louppe, Recurrent Machines for Likelihood-Free Inference (2018), NeurIPS 2018 Workshop on Meta-Learning

9. Are your tags precise enough?

The more specific your tags, the easier it is for readers to find your article and for us to classify and recommend your post to the relevant audience.

Depending on the tags you choose, your post will be featured on our data science, machine learning, programming or visualization page. Please choose precise tags as we can’t allow a post to be in all our categories at once.

We may change one or two tags before publication. We would do this only to keep our different sections relevant to our readers. For instance, we would want to avoid tagging a post on linear regression as “Artificial Intelligence”.

10. Do you have an amazing image?

A great image attracts and excites readers. That’s why all the best newspapers always display incredible pictures.

This is what you can do to add a fantastic featured image to your post:

Use Unsplash. Most of the content on Unsplash is released under Creative Commons CC0, which means their photos are safe to use without asking for permission — even for commercial purposes.

Take one yourself . Your phone is almost certainly good enough to capture a cool image of your surroundings. You might even already have an image on your phone that would make a great addition to your article.

. Your phone is almost certainly good enough to capture a cool image of your surroundings. You might even already have an image on your phone that would make a great addition to your article. Make a great graph. If your post involves data analysis, spend some time making at least one graph truly unique. You can try R, Python, D3.js or Plotly.

If you decide to purchase a license for an image to be used in your article, please note that we only allow the use of images under a license that: (i) does not expire; and (ii) that can be used for commercial purposes on the TDS Publication. You are responsible for ensuring you comply with the license terms of use. You must also include a caption below the image, as follows, or as otherwise required by the license provider: “Image via [license provider’s name] under license to [your name].” Finally, please email us a copy of a receipt or other evidence of the purchased license, along with the corresponding license terms of use.

Please remember to cite the source of your images even if you aren’t legally obligated to do so. If you created an image yourself, you can add (Image by author) in the caption. Whichever way you decide to go, your image source should look like this:",https://towardsdatascience.com/questions-96667b06af5,Tds Editors,2020-12-12 23:54:52.970000+00:00,"Writers’ Guide,Join Us,Tds Team,Writers Guide"
People Are Still Vacationing in the Middle of a Pandemic,"Every time I think people can’t amaze me further with their stupidity, I’m sadly mistaken. Yes, stupidity. Or would you rather I say dangerous behavior? Either works.

As of today, in the United States alone, there have been 13.7m cases of the novel coronavirus, with almost 270k deaths.

What in those numbers gives you the idea that travel is a good idea? Now, it would be one thing if people were vacationing to parts unknown, not surrounding themselves with people. But that’s really not the case. People are still going to Disney. The park recently announced they’re open for business again, minus the water parks.

Just be sure if you’re over the age of 2, you wear a mask at all times.

Wearing a mask is important for sure. But you can’t tell me a crowd the size of the ones that frequent Disney isn’t a recipe for disaster. It’s not only dangerous, it’s destructive. No amount of memory making is worth the potential for death, or at the least, severe illness.

I blame the companies for agreeing to open in such a dangerous situation. I blame our government for not doing more to stop this on the front end. But I also blame the people of the United States who can’t put their plans on hold for a little longer in order to remain safe, and for the health and well-being of others.

Going on vacation would be a godsend right now for my family. We’ve been stuck at home since March, invading one another’s space, constantly under each other. Sure, it’s nice to spend time with your family, but enough is enough. Through all this, there’s no vacation on this planet that’s worth our continued health. We even avoided a small Thanksgiving get-together to ensure we remained virus free.

Whether you have children, if you’re single or married, your health and well-being are important. Consistently masking up, only going out when absolutely necessary, and avoiding crowds goes a long way towards ending this pandemic. Taking a family vacation, just because it’s what you’ve always done, isn’t the smart answer.

The state of the world isn’t what it’s always been. We have to adapt and overcome. Roll with the punches, if you will. But for all that is holy, stay home this holiday season and plan the vacations for when it’s safer. If you don’t, your vacation memories could be the last ones you make.",https://medium.com/the-bad-influence/people-are-still-vacationing-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic-77e91bb4f632,Chloe Cuthbert,2020-12-02 12:32:58.069000+00:00,"Health,The Bad Influence,Mental Health,Self-awareness,Coronavirus"
Google Objectron — A giant leap for the 3D object detection,"bjecrPhoto by Tamara Gak on Unsplash

Google Objectron — A giant leap for the 3D object detection

Google has just announced the launch of MediaPipe Objectron, its mobile technology for real-time detection of 3D objects, enabling the smartphone to recognize the size and orientation of objects.

If there one thing that I love in Google’s research is image analysis. The automatic suggestions of Google Photos or the capabilities of Google Lens are good examples, and the recent news that the company already has its new layer of analysis-ready to understand what is present in each photo.

If we go a little further, to object detection as such, Google also has a few tricks up its sleeve.

Google has just announced the launch of MediaPipe Objectron, its mobile technology for detecting 3D objects in real-time, allowing the smartphone to recognize an object’s size and orientation, opening several application doors.

What is Object Detection?

Humans’ intrinsic ability to rapidly detect, differentiate, and classify objects allows us to make quick decisions regarding what we see.

Detection of objects in images remains one of the most significant challenges in the field of computer vision since objects found in images can be perceived from the most diverse viewpoints and transformations in size and rotation, making it more difficult to detect.

Digital cameras provide good advantages among the critical sensors that AI can use: they can be lightweight, compact, and inexpensive, essential for some environments.

To achieve object detection goals, methods for the extraction of image information, visual attention models, and bio-inspired learning models have been studied to identify and classify vehicles.

Object detection is crucial for good object recognition. A classification technique is to formulate it as a classification problem. Objects are instances with well-defined limits and center, unlike the background.

Methods for detecting and recognizing objects require fewer resources to perform rapid detection due to the increased computational cost. The advanced and complex classifier, such as the CNN — Convolutional Neural Network, is necessary to obtain high accuracy in the Detections.

Detection theories can be used to classify small, low cost or low consumption, electronics, transportation, health, safety, among other areas.

The CNN Object Detection problem

The difference between object classification methods (like the networks in the previous section) and object detection methods is that in object detection, you want to:

identify how many objects of a given category are in the image;

objects of a given category are in the image; identify where in the image each object is located.

It is typically not known in advance how many instances of a given object category you will identify in a scene. If you were to build a standard CNN to solve this problem, you would have the following situation: the output size is variable. It depends on how many instances of an object you will find and where they are, which is impossible on a network with an output layer of fixed size. For this, models such as R-CNN and YOLO were developed.

R-CNN: Regions with CNN feature

R-CNN performs segmentation based on the results of object detection. R-CNN initially uses selective search to extract many candidates and then calculates its characteristics through CNN. Finally, it classifies each region using a specific linear classifier, usually SVM (support vector machines). Unlike the networks discussed in the previous section, R-CNN can perform more complex tasks, such as object detection and coarse segmentation of images. An R-CNN can be built on traditional image classification networks, such as AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet.

R-CNN solves the problem of multiple exits using a selective search as follows:

1. Generate initial sub-segmentation; we generate many candidate regions

2. Use a greedy algorithm to combine similar regions into larger ones recursively

3. Use the generated regions to produce the final candidate region proposals

R-CNN initially generates around 2000 candidates using the above algorithm based on simple traditional computer vision techniques. From there:

Each candidate is reformatted to a standard size square image; Image is fed to a neural network that generates 4096-dimension feature vectors as output; An SVM classifies the vector of characteristics producing two outputs: a rating an offset indication that can be used to adjust the bounding box.

Disadvantages of the model:

Slow to train: training is in two stages; Very slow to execute: for each image, R-CNN first classifies 2000 sub-images.

Fast-R-CNN: Fast Region-based Convolutional Networks for object detection

In an article the following year, the authors of R-CNN presented a solution that solves the problems of slowness in the approach based on the analysis of 2000 semi-random images of R-CNN: convolutional preprocessing.

Instead of feeding the neural network with candidate images, the entire image is provided to the network to generate a convolutional feature map ( CFM ). This CFM is then used to search for candidate regions, which are reformatted into fixed-size square images through a region-of-interest pooling layer ( RoI pooling ). From the characteristic vector generated for each RoI, a classification is performed with a softmax layer, which predicts the object category and associates it with the origin square’s bounding box.

The graph below shows a comparison between the two approaches and another network from the same time, SPP-Net (Spatial Pyramid Pooling in Deep Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition) :

Faster-R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks

Again, the same authors found a solution to make the network even faster was to eliminate the selective search for regions of interest. Similar to Fast R-CNN, the image is used directly as an input to generate a convolutional feature map. In this model, however, instead of performing a selective search on this map, a second, separate neural network is used to predict candidate regions. It is called the Region Proposal Network (RPN). RPN uses a neural mini-network based on a sliding window that analyzes the input image, and the translation is invariant. To avoid excessive proposals, suppression of non-maximums is carried out at this stage.

These candidate regions, like Fast-R-CNN, are reformatted into fixed-size square images through a region-of-interest pooling layer ( RoI pooling ). From the characteristic vector generated for each RoI, a classification is performed with a softmax layer, which predicts the object category and associates it with the bounding box given by the square of origin.

The image below shows a comparison between the three models of the authors and SPP-Net :

Single Shot Detection Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Recognition

The above approaches use to focus on the sub-regions of the image to identify objects. The network never looks at the image as a whole. Here we will see approaches that consider the image as a whole.

You Only Look Once: YOLO

In YOLO, a single convolutional network predicts both the bounding boxes and the probabilities of belonging to each detected object’s class. For this, YOLO works as follows:

an image is taken and divided into an SxS grid of cells; using the grid as a reference, m bounding boxes are generated ; bounding boxes with a probability above a threshold are selected and used to locate the object within the image.

Much faster YOLO (45 fps on the authors’ set -> up to two orders of magnitude) faster than contemporary algorithms. Its biggest flaw is inaccuracy with small objects in the image.

Each cell in the grid can predict B bounding boxes ( bbox ) and C class probabilities. A bbox prediction has five components: (x, y, w, h, confidence). The coordinates (x, y) represent the center of the bbox relative to the location of the cell (if the center of a bbox does not fall into a cell, it will not be responsible for it and will not represent it -> cells only have a reference to objects whose center falls into them). These coordinates are normalized to [0, 1]. The bbox (w, h) dimensions are also normalized to [0, 1], relative to the image size.

Suppose you split a 448 × 448-pixel image into a grid of SxS = 3 × 3 cells:

In YOLO, the concept of intersection over union (IoU) plays an important role: the confidence of a prediction in YOLO is given by Pr (Object) * IOU (pred, truth).

Detecting 3D objects in real-time.

While there are ample amounts of 3D data for street scenes, due to the popularity of research into self-driving cars that rely on 3D capture sensors like LIDAR, datasets with ground truth 3D annotations for more granular everyday objects are minimal. To overcome this problem, we developed a novel data pipeline using mobile augmented reality (AR) session data. With the arrival of ARCore and ARKit, hundreds of millions of smartphones now have AR capabilities and the ability to capture additional information during an AR session, including the camera pose, sparse 3D point clouds, estimated lighting, and planar surfaces.

We built a novel annotation tool for AR session data to label ground truth data, allowing annotators to label 3D bounding boxes for objects quickly. This tool uses a split-screen view to display 2D video frames on overlaid 3D bounding boxes on the left, alongside a view showing 3D point clouds, camera positions, and detected planes on the right. Annotators draw 3D bounding boxes in the 3D view and verify its location by reviewing the projections in 2D video frames. For static objects, we only need to annotate an object in a single frame and propagate its location to all frames using the ground truth camera pose information from the AR session data, making the procedure highly efficient.

MediaPipe is Google’s cross-platform framework for creating different data processing pipelines. Objetron is included within this framework as a moving pipeline for real-time 3D object detection.

In other words, Objectron detects objects through 2D images to later estimate their orientation and size through a machine learning model trained on a 3D data set. In other words, it is capable of detecting 3D objects from a single RGB image.

But understanding objects in 3D remains a challenging task due to the lack of large real-world datasets compared to 2D tasks (e.g., ImageNet, COCO, and Open Images).

So, to empower the research community for continued advancement in 3D object understanding, there is a strong need for the release of object-centric video datasets, which capture more of the 3D structure of an object, while matching the data format used for many vision tasks (i.e., video or camera streams), to aid in the training and benchmarking of machine learning models.

Through an encoder and decoder model, Google can convert a 2D input into a 3D output. A single image is enough.

At the basic structure level, the model has an encoder-decoder architecture based on MobileNetV2, Google’s neural networks for classification and visual detection. Using these networks, the 2D projection of the image, and a 3D estimation algorithm, the model can process a 3D output of said object.

To mitigate possible fluctuations in the image, Google has worked under the same detection and tracking framework for its 2D objects. This translates into something that will already sound familiar to you if you know how Google works: image segmentation.

The original image is captured in 2D. Bounding boxes are applied to it for subsequent object detection. The object is detected by Gaussian distribution. The segmentation mask is applied.

Google highlights that the model is so light that it can run in real-time at 26 FPS on a high-end mobile, specifically with the Adreno 650 (the GPU of the recent Snapdragon 865). The new solution is now available to anyone who wants to test it to develop new use cases and applications.

The Dataset

The Objectron dataset is a collection of short, object-centric video clips accompanied by AR session metadata that includes camera poses, sparse point-clouds, and characterization of the planar surfaces in the surrounding environment.

In each video, the camera moves around the object, capturing it from different angles. The data also contains manually annotated 3D bounding boxes for each object, which describe the object’s position, orientation, and dimensions.

The dataset consists of 15K annotated video clips supplemented with over 4M annotated images in the following categories: bikes, books, bottles, cameras, cereal boxes, chairs, cups, laptops, and shoes. It is stored in the objectron bucket on Google Cloud Storage.

Along with the dataset, Google is also sharing a 3D object detection solution for four categories of objects — shoes, chairs, mugs, and cameras.

These models are released in MediaPipe, Google’s open-source framework for cross-platform customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media, which also powers ML solutions like the on-device real-time hand, iris, and body pose tracking.

By releasing this Objectron dataset, Google hopes to enable the research community to push the limits of 3D object geometry understanding and foster new research and applications, such as view synthesis, improved 3D representation, and unsupervised learning.

Dataset Key Features

15000 annotated videos and 4M annotated images

All samples include high-res images, object pose, camera pose, point-cloud, and surface planes.

Ready to use examples in various tf.record formats, which can be used in Tensorflow/PyTorch.

Object-centric multi-views, observing the same object from different angles.

Accurate evaluation metrics, like 3D IoU for oriented 3D bounding boxes.

Conclusion

Humans’ intrinsic ability to rapidly detect, differentiate, and classify objects allows us to make quick decisions regarding what we see.

Detection of objects in images remains one of the most significant challenges in the field of computer vision since objects found in images can be perceived from the most diverse viewpoints and transformations in size and rotation, making it more difficult to detect.

Object detection is crucial for good object recognition. There is a lot of excitement about this google release, especially considering that today there are powerful augmented reality platforms such as AR Core in Google and AR Kit in what refers to Apple.

Video games, applications, photography, video, and more can all benefit from object recognition.

Let’s keep one eye on this technology for future activities and developments by joining the Objectron mailing list and visiting Google’s GitHub page.

"No, You Don’t Need to Write Everyday","Just to be clear, I’m not saying that writing every day is a bad thing, what I’m saying is do what is sustainable, at whatever pace that works, for you. Whatever motivates you to write consistently and intentionally for weeks, months, years; instead of feeling success at your fingertips while burning yourself to the ground in the process. Do whatever makes you write better, and hopefully, forever. And no, you don’t have to be miserable to be an artist. Be happier and healthier than that, your work, your body, and your mind will appreciate it.

Let me be real with you, there are days I could hardly get to the shower, let alone sit down (or up?) and write 500 words. On those days, I could feel my anxiety so physically like an invisible rock clinging against my chest. Sometimes, it grows legs and moves up to my throat, preventing me from raising my already-stifled voice. On those days, I don’t write despite the unbearable fear of me not working, not producing, not doing enough, not being enough. Because deep down, I know I write better when I’m well-rested; when ideas flow from my mind onto the computer’s screen without me having to think too hard about it.

Have you done something and later you exclaim with pride and excitement mixed with a little of confusion “I did that!?”?. That’s where you want to be, not grinding your words onto the page like a chore; which way of creating is gonna make you miserable at the end of the process.

So you know what? Binge that TV show. Finish the books that have been collecting dust on your slightly messy desk. Go out. Drink a cup of tea. Go hiking. Go to the gym. Go to the woods. Don’t forget to take naps because naps are the best! Do whatever you need to cope as the kids say, and keep yourself healthy, mentally and physically. Self-care is your first and foremost responsibility, cliche as it sounds. If your creative career takes a bit longer to take off, that’s okay. Because when you’re not happy, what’s the point of success? Success is the high you feel for 2 minutes (maybe a little more, or a little less, perhaps it’ll last for days if you’re lucky but eventually it’ll fade) after you achieve the very thing you’ve been trying to reach for years. Then there you are, alone yet again with your miserable self after the high subsides.

Do you want to be happy with your success, or do you want to feel dead inside because you have nothing left to give?

AI Unfolds the Science Behind a 50-Year-Old Protein-Folding Problem,"DeepMind’s AlphaFold.

Three decades after CASP issued its challenge to the scientific community, a most promising solution has surfaced using AI to predict the shapes of protein structures with accuracy that has yet to be seen. DeepMind, a company devoted to developing artificial intelligence systems to solve intelligence and advance scientific discovery, partnered with CASP to solve biology’s grand challenge. AlphaFold is DeepMind’s deep-learning system that has been proven to “accurately predict the structure of proteins to within the width of an atom”.

AlphaFold was trained to analyze the structure of proteins using a databank of roughly 170,000 protein structures. During testing, AlphaFold achieved an average score of 92.4 GDT (Global Distance Test) in its predictions. The competitive threshold score: 90 GDT. This means that AlphaFold’s abilities are easily competitive with the results obtained using experimental methods, such as cryo-electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and x-ray crystallography. These experimental methods can take years to determine the shape of a protein. In contrast, AlphaFold can manage it in a few days. Achieving a score of over 90 reveals that any difference in the predicted and actual structure could be from experimental error in the experimental method — not the software. Alternatively, an error could predict an alternative protein configuration that could occur due to natural variation. The global distance test the results are based on is a scale of 0 to 100 which dictates how close the AI predicted structure is to the actual shape of the protein as determined from experimental methods.

AlphaFold was able to predict the structure of proteins with a margin of error of 1.6 angstroms (0.16 nanometers). This is equivalent to roughly the width of an atom. AlphaFold was able to accomplish the unthinkable. While scientists can determine the sequence of amino acids that make up a protein, there are thousands (an understatement) of ways that a protein can fold to achieve a three-dimensional shape. Back in 1972, Christian Anfinsen won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for proving that protein shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. However, for the next 50 or so years, the scientific community had been grappling with trying to understand the shapes that proteins could fold into.

According to DeepMind, their latest version of AlphaFold used in the recent CASP experiment was created using an attention-based neural network system. The system was trained end-to-end to be able to interpret the structure of a spacial graph which can be used to predict the shape of a folded protein. The system then goes on to reason over the implicit graph that it is building. AlphaFold “uses evolutionarily related sequences, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), and a representation of amino acid residue pairs to refine this graph.” This iterative process allowed AlphaFold to develop solid predictions about the shape of a protein in as little as a few days. Finally, an internal confidence method in AlphaFold is used to determine which parts of the predicted protein shape are reliable.

AlphaFold’s ability to predict the shape of proteins has given new life to the study of diseases, something that has been thrust into the forefront of biology in the last year with a new urgency. DeepMind’s technology could help virologists identify proteins that have become impaired to help understand how they interact in this new malfunctioning state. Success in this field could lead to more precise drug development, further insight into existing experimental methods, and hopefully the realization of more efficient treatments for a variety of diseases and viruses.

DeepMind has even had the chance to use their AI in a real-world situation, having aided in early studies on the protein structures of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. AlphaFold was able to identify several related protein structures that had previously been unknown, helping scientists to better understand the nature of the virus.

DeepMind is currently in the process of preparing a paper concerning their system that will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.",https://medium.com/predict/ai-unfolds-the-science-behind-a-50-year-old-protein-folding-problem-13baf1d43d84,Madison Hunter,2020-12-09 01:14:46.594000+00:00,"Machine Learning,Biotechnology,Artificial Intelligence,Future,Science"
Discover the Forgotten Treasures in Your Creative Cellar,"Image by David Schwarzenberg from Pixabay

How many unfinished creative writing projects do you have lurking in your cellar? Your first story? A notebook full of ideas from the writing residential you attended three years ago but fell out with one of your classmates, so you dare not look back there?

If you’ve finished one story, I bet you have a store because the imagination is like a weed in its ability to spread all on its own, come sun or shade. Once you’ve opened that creative door, it is hard to shut; I imagine, I’ve never tried.

So if you’ve been writing for a few years; attended more than one kind of class or workshop then I bet you’ve got a stock of half baked stories and ideas lurking around in your memory, desk drawer or hard drive.

Before I share my 6-step process for excavating the magic from your lost stories and getting them moving again here’s a little anecdote about a writer, we all know a lot about already.

Oh no, not another Stephen King writing analogy! Yes, I’m afraid so, but this one conveys how easy it is to discard goldmine ideas, and it’s not about craft.

It’s about Carrie, his first published novel. After his initial spark of inspiration for the story, he wrote a three-page first draft and promptly threw it in the bin, deciding he didn’t like it. It wasn’t worth wasting any more time on, and it would never sell.

His wife, curious about the crumpled pages protruding from his bin, took it out, read it and loved the story. She pushed him on, wanting to know what would happen next. And so he finished it, and you know the rest; he published his debut novel, was rescued from imminent poverty and forged a long successful career.

The takeaway features for un-repped/unpublished authors are;

- It isn’t easy to be objective about our work.

- It is easy to abandon a story.

- It’s hard to spot the gold amongst the fog of endless rejections.

- It’s easy to lose inspiration.

- The time when you’re most likely to give up, the beginning, it’s hardest to see the potential.

Plus it feeds into my romantic view about the first draft of any story being a living, breathing thing in existence in the world. Long may this optimism last!

We need to take on the role of treasure hunter ourselves. Who uses a waste paper basket anymore? Here’s my excavation process for seeking out the gold in the mountain of half-finished and forgotten stories that have amassed over the last seven years of writing.

1. Storyhunting

It’s time to get your gloves on and start exploring your spaces. Maybe you’re all digital, lucky you! My handwriting days have left a chest full of notebooks and stolen A0 notepads. If this exercise is worth doing, it’s worth doing correctly.

My creative cellar includes:

One Drive and old pc hard drives

Notebooks

Emails from course tutors

Course notes in hard and digital copy.

In this phase, you need to get them all into one place. Don’t worry about reading them just yet. We’re in the stock-take mode, and it’s feeling good.

2. Organising

I’ve come to the unfortunate realisation that amongst all of the character swashbuckling, living a Rimbaudian existence, research and inspiration chasing, the organising of any project is an essential part because without this you, you know, lose your stories!

It’s time to note down the following:

The title, draft and date

What was the inspiration?

Who is your favourite character?

What form is the story?

For this, you’ll need a spreadsheet.

It’s fun; you remember how much you’ve got already and recall some of the adventures along the way.

3. Reading

The thought of reading your old work might fill you with the dreads, but there are more upsides than down, as you’ll discover.

For every cringe you sound out loud, you can also celebrate how much you’ve learned and grown as a writer.

But more importantly, there is a reason you started this project. What was it? A person? An injustice? A character? A response to another piece of literature?

Finding the spark of inspiration will be worth any pain you feel at the reminder of what an amateur writer you used to be.

As you go along make a note of the bits, you like. Maybe it’s just a description of a bluebell woods; perhaps it’s an antagonist or a brilliant line of dialogue. It’s unlikely that you don’t find something that’s still breathing in each of your old stories.

4. Repositioning

Now you’re familiar with your stories again, and you’ve remembered what inspired you to write them in the first place is there a better way to tell the story? Maybe you’ve written a stage play that would be better as a film script or even a short story. Perhaps a television idea you started penning would be better as a novel.

With everything you’ve learned about storytelling, is there a better platform for your story?

Remember that the options are endless:

Flash fiction, microfiction, novella, novels, films, radio plays, stage plays, short film, web series, series.

An old playwriting tutor once spelt this out for me, it might seem obvious to you but here goes,

The written word of novels and short stories is best suited for exploring conflict that happens within the self.

The stage is best suited for exploring the conflict between people.

Film is best suited for exploring the conflict between people and their world.

A few repositioning questions; is your story in its best format? Is your main character a dynamic character, or is there someone else who can take the protagonist spot?

A tutor at a workshop once said to me that the biggest problem he saw with scripts was that it was full of characters that had situations put onto them; instead of characters that created their conditions.

5. Big Picture

Now you’ve changed or confirmed the landing for your story, how are you going to get there? What’s the most astonishingly extraordinary thing that could happen to this story? Then turn it into action like you would for one of your characters.

Think big; try the +10 rule. You lost the idea the first time around; this time, you need to go bigger.

What actions do you need to take to make this happen? List everything — cleaning your desk, finishing up a project to allow time for this one, eating more beans, getting rid of the energy demons in your life.

Destroy all obstacles in the way of you and your story’s bigger picture.

6. Action Plan

The action plan is the most straightforward step of all. You’ve got your vision; add a date, add milestones and list teeny steps you need to take to complete the task. Example steps might include finding a publishing platform, sending a nice email to a friend who might be kind enough to read your story — think meta!

Here’s an old blog about action planning your screenplay rewrite; the process will be the same.

"The Neuroscientist, A Field Guide","Sub-species

The Electrophysiologist

The recorder of single neurons, lowerer of electrodes. Notable tribes include the patch-clampers, whose cruel initiation rites require attaching a micrometer-scale piece of glass to the body of a neuron ten times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. Some among this tribe, possibly insane, attempt the same in awake, moving animals. They are easily distinguished from other Neuroscientus by the rhythmic beating of their heads against the lab bench when losing yet another neuron after just three trials of behaviour are complete.

The Systems Neuroscientist

Distinguishable from the electrophysiologist by trying to record from many neurons at the same time, and relate them to something in the outside world. Comes in many tribes, from the sensory obsessives, the memorists and decisionists, to the motor wagglers, through others that identify themselves by blobs of the brain — the corticians, cerebellites, the basal gang, the hippocampites, the amygdalarians — to yet others that identify with the type of brain — the worm-wranglers, the fly-fanciers, the sea-sluggers. To the naive observer these tribes would all seem to be working towards the same goal, but vicious internecine wars frequently erupt within and between tribes.

Insufferably smug since members of their subspecies were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2014 (“we’re a real science now”), they are nonetheless handicapped by the crudeness of their tools, which has led to the Humphries Uncertainty Principle: they can either record precisely when neurons send spikes but not know exactly where they are, or know precisely where they are but not know exactly when they send spikes (they call these “multi-electrode recording” and “calcium imaging”, respectively).

The Cognitive Neuroscientist

This subspecies is more intensely interested in us Sapiens than any other. We find it useful to distinguish a number of breeds, albeit with some overlap:

Neuroimager — often referred to by other subspecies as “a psychologist with a magnet”, they adore rainbow colours. A deeply superstitious people, yet highly intelligent. In their writings frequent references are made to “Bonferroni”, possibly a deity, and they will cross themselves and mutter curses to the heavens upon hearing the phrase “dead salmon”. But the complex incantations necessary to turn the magnetic alignment of oxygen-depleted haemoglobin into a measurable signal of brain activity is testament to their ingenuity.

Scalp tickler — a “psychologist with a hairnet”, readily identified by their distinctive calls. Anthropologists have transcribed some of these calls (lit. “P100”, “N2”), but have yet to discern their meaning. Some authorities subdivide a further breed, the Magnetiser, a psychologist with a quantum thingy.

The Paddlers — believe that waving a magic wand near the scalp of a Sapiens will variously cause involuntary movement, enhance their mathematical ability, or let them experience the presence of god(s).

The Neuroanatomist

Was thought to be going extinct, until the Connectomics Explosion approximately 15YA rapidly diversified the gene pool, with many new, previously unrecorded phenotypes appearing.

Neural Engineer

Consider the brain to be a feedback loop. Fiddles with amplifier settings until the squealing stops.

Behavioural Neuroscientist

Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching a rodent press a lever. Talks almost entirely in capital letters (example transcript: “the US will become the CS, but leave the UR intact”).

Neuroethologist

Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching an animal go about its daily routine. Barely on speaking terms with Behavioural Neuroscientists.

Neuroendocrinologist

Slightly hormonal. Obsessed with how everything sloshing around the brain that isn’t a neurotransmitter affects brain cells. Believes a “raster plot” is a graph drawn by a Bob Marley fan.

Molecular neuroscientist

Applies the tools of close cousins the molecular biologist to the brain. Loves the stuff floating inside cells, especially proteins and complex chains of chemicals signalling to each other. Unable to distinguish the brain from the liver without assistance.

Neurogeneticist

Obsessed with the expression of bits of DNA and RNA in brain cells. Unable to distinguish the brain from yeast without assistance.



Clinical Neuroscientist

Haughty and proud, these interact the most with Homo sapiens, bringing their skills to treat the damaged and sick among that closely-related species. Males of this sub-species are thought to be born wearing a suit and tie.

Computational Neuroscientist

Often gaunt, frequently shunning daylight, these shy creatures have also a number of distinctive breeds. Recent gene sequencing work on this sub-species has revealed evidence of lateral gene transfer from known species of Physicists, Mathematicians, and Computer Scientists. The consequent melange of languages spoken among members of this sub-species often collapses interactions into mutual bafflement.

Circuit modeller — Literal-minded to a fault, these build exact scale models of bits of brain. Often try to show them to their fellow Systems Neuroscientists working on the same bit of brain, but suffer frequent barbs and social rejection (“Suited for a more specialist journal”).

The Algorithmics — Seek the Holy Grail of the step-by-step instructions by which the brain works. Once discovered that deep-lying neurons, which may or may not contain dopamine, send a signal that looked like the difference: [actual value of what happened] — [predicted value of what happened]. Have been banging on about it for the past 25 years.

Compartmentalist — Uses a thousand equations to describe a single neuron, none of whose parameters are experimentally determined. Often found weeping silently into a drink at conference bars. Worship at the Church of Rall.

The Bayesians — Have discovered a hammer, and are determined to use it on absolutely bloody anything that’s not already nailed down.

4. You’re most creative when you’re least sharp

We each have our “peak” and “off-peak” times of day.

Counterintuitively, the science shows you’re most creative during your off-peak time of day.

If you’re groggy in the morning, don’t reach for coffee first thing: That grogginess is a creative gift.

5. Creative work happens in stages

A great idea doesn’t mean your idea is ready to ship. There are four stages of creativity:

1. Preparation: Learn about the problem

2. Incubation: Let it sink in

3. Illumination: Have the idea

4. Verification: Get it ready to ship

Respect these stages, don’t get blocked.

6. Not all hours are equal

Some hours are great for having ideas — other hours are great for executing on those ideas.

Dan Ariely and I noticed working on Timeful (Google acquired) there aren’t 24 hours in the day — there’s an hour here or there for each type of thinking.

Here’s what the late, great, Anders Ericsson saw when he looked at the practice schedules of the very best violinists: Intense practice in the morning. Sporadic practice the rest of the day.

7. The world works in cycles

You can work with cycles in your world to propel your ideas forward.

Days, weeks, seasons, and years can be harnessed to cycle through the Four Stages of Creativity.

For example, you can use a night’s rest, a relaxing weekend, or a cozy winter as Incubation:",https://medium.com/getting-art-done/11-reasons-creativity-productivity-is-about-mind-management-not-time-management-d86ea9fcfb21,David Kadavy,2020-11-17 15:19:47.445000+00:00,"Productivity,Creativity,Time Management,Writing,Psychology"
Are Headline Analyzer Tools Really Helpful for Writers — A Case Study,"Headline Analyzer Tools that I Used

In this article, I’ve used the 5 most known headline analyzer tools to investigate whether they’re beneficial for writers or not.

One of the best ways to attract users' attention is being able to make the readers feel emotional while they are skimming through the plethora of headlines already available online. Regardless of it being sadness, happiness, anger, or even shock, evoking any emotion in a reader is sufficient to get a click.

So, if you’re looking to capture a user's attention through emotions, Advanced Marketing Institute’s Emotional marketing value headline analyzer is the best tool for you. This blog title analyzer measures the EMV (emotional marketing value) to the headlines.

Additionally, the tool also provides information about what emotion you are likely to evoke, which will help you determine if this is per the action you want the users to take. For example, if you want the user to get inspired and purchase your product, it’s probably not the best idea to evoke anger.

How to Write a Dynamite Pitch For Your Guest Post,"How to Write a Dynamite Pitch For Your Guest Post

Get your words in front of thousands at lightning speed

Photo by Nainoa Shizuru on Unsplash

Do you want to be famous?

I’m not talking about being so famous you can’t go to the grocery store without a team of bodyguards. But if that’s what you want, more power to you!

I’m talking about credibility. You get that by being known as an authority in your niche. When you achieve that status, you become a go-to guide people turn to when they’re looking for the latest and best insights in the business you’re in.

Wouldn’t that be great?

Guest posting is a fantastic way to give your message the boost it needs.

So how do you approach an Influencer?

You might be thinking, “Who am I to ask the biggest blogger I know to let me write for them?”

What I’m about to say will encourage you and maybe even shock you.

It doesn’t matter who you are.

If you have a great idea for a post that will make an Influencer look good, they’ll be glad to hear it. And more importantly, if your idea lifts their audience to a higher level of performance, you’ll have your best shot ever of getting your foot in the door.

Just make sure it’s original, inspiring, and useful.

Here’s what most people do wrong.

If you want to get ignored, do this.

Talk about yourself. Focus on your own needs. Tell the Influencer that using her platform will really help your career take off.

She doesn’t care what you want.

What she cares about is her agenda.

Do you know what it is?

It’s easy to figure out.

Ask yourself why you read her blog every week. Think about some of the wins you got reading her posts. Are they inspiring? Useful? What is her writing style? Does she have a lot of other voices contributing to the conversation?

The more you know, the better your pitch will be.

Think about it. This blog is big and popular because the Blogger was intentional about it. She has a clear mission and she dedicates all her efforts to promoting it. She’s not going to let just anybody come in and blow it all. Writing for her is a privilege, not a God-given right.

Remember that, and you’ll be much more successful getting a guest spot.

Use This Template and You’ll Maximize Your Chances of Getting a Yes.

Make sure your pitch is short, friendly, and direct.

Influencers are busy. They probably have assistants reading their emails. And if you think your inbox is crowded, multiply that times a thousand for them.

So you’ve got to stand out.

First and always, follow the guidelines.

Most bloggers who accept guest posts will spell out what they want. They’ll tell you what topics they’re looking for, how long the posts should be, and what style of writing they publish.

I know sometimes it’s okay to break the rules when you write. Don’t make it these rules.

Rules are a screen as much as resumés are for job applicants. If you satisfy enough of the criteria, your submission won’t get tossed out. If you exceed what’s expected and offer something that wows them, you’re almost assured of getting a shot at a guest post.

Use a proven template to pitch.

We said before to make your pitch short, friendly, and direct.

Short means 3 paragraphs max. No more than 5–6 sentences total. Any longer and everything you did to make them happy before won’t mean a thing.

Line 1 — Compliment them.

Don’t be vague here. Tell them something specific, like,

“I loved your post last week on how to break bad habits for good. It was a game changer for me, helping me quit smoking after being hooked for 30 years.”

And be sure you’re honest here. If you can give them a specific example of how it helped, that’s much better than the generic phrase everyone uses:

I love your work.

So dig deep if you must, and be specific. It will make you stand out from the other form submissions they’re getting.

Line 2 — Make your proposal.

Do you see a gap you can fill with your wisdom? Is there a question in the comments somewhere that didn’t get answered well enough? Can you see something on the horizon in your industry that no one else is seeing or talking about yet?

Make your proposal in a sentence or two. Only make it longer if the guidelines specify that you should. The point here is that if you can capture your idea in one sentence, the rest of the writing will come a lot easier.

And more importantly, it will be laser-focused.

Be sure to make your proposal clear so the reader understands it as well as you do. In fact, it should be so clear that it can pass the test of a casual glance. Remember, the person who reads your email is busy. She won’t work to figure out what you meant. So be clear right from the start.

If you’re not sure its clear, ask your friends and colleagues if they understand what you want to write.

Line 3 — Thank them again.

This is simple courtesy. Tell them you appreciate their consideration and hope to hear from them. But even if you don’t, you’ll still be a fan.

That’s it.

What to do if it’s rejected.

Sometimes you might offer something they have enough of already.

That’s okay. Read the blog every time they publish something new. Go back as far as you can into the archives to see where they’ve gone over time. See what the blog owner is doing on Twitter.

This kind of research will help you more than anything. When you know what the Influencer really wants, you can use her own desires to gain a hearing.

After all, the best way to make a friend is to make that person feel important, right?

Now Do This

Find the biggest blog in your niche and offer to write something that compliments their mission. Once you get a yes, tell me about it.

If you’ve guest posted before, what strategy did you use to get a chance to write?

When you lift an Influencer’s audience, you lift yourself. That’s the only way you’ll ever grow your audience long term.",https://medium.com/writtenpersuasion/how-to-write-a-dynamite-pitch-for-your-guest-post-e49efaa9d9c,Frank Mckinley,2018-08-08 11:11:11.361000+00:00,"Marketing,Personal Development,Creativity,Entrepreneurship,Writing"
"Amazon, Google and Apple recently Enabled Their Products To “Listen” for These 3 Reasons","Amazon, Google and Apple Recently Enabled Their Products To “Listen” for These 3 Reasons

iPhone, Apple Watch and Pixel Buds- What you can do with their new sound detection features

Humans are born to detect threats by staying alert to sounds.

We get nervous when we hear footsteps walking behind us in a dark street. We are all ears and alert when we are about to go to bed and hear something outside the bedroom.

With limited sight at night, or at home alone, we often depend solely on sounds to understand the surroundings.

But what about when we are distracted? Can you hear the door knock when you are listening to music wearing big headphones? Or how do I know the car behind me honked to warn me of approaching with my noise cancelling mode on? What about for those who have hearing loss? What if I want to know if my dog barks and upset my neighbors while I’m away?

Big tech companies have come up with solutions to these problems thanks to the recent breakthroughs with sound AI technology — and now they are able to build these Machine learning-based sound detection features into their devices as small as earbuds.

Starting from 2019, Amazon, Google and Apple have competitively released sound detection features, mainly for these three purposes.

#1. Home security: Smart speakers can listen for suspicious activities while you are away

In May 2019, Amazon rolled out Alexa Guard, enabling Amazon Echo speakers to transition into Guard Mode by saying a command like “Alexa, I’m leaving”.

If sounds like glass break, CO alarm or human activity including footfalls or door opening is detected, it will send a notification to your phone. You can also configure it to lock any doors with compatible smart locks, or deter unwanted visitors by turning on/off lights to make it appear as if you’re home, sound dog barking sound or a siren when activity is detected. Similarly, in November 2019, Google released glass break detection for its smart speaker, Nest Secure.

In fact, sound recognition technology applied to home security is not a brand-new concept. Prior to the deep-learning based sound detection method like the example of Alexa Guard, a rule-based sound detection method had been used conventionally, which basically recognizes sound by loudness and magnitude of frequency. Traditional glass break detectors or smoke alarm detectors are built with this rule-based technology.

“Rule-based” system, as its name implies, is confined by knowledge and rules given manually by human. As a result, it was not useful for complex environment where there were high frequency of exceptional patterns and thus, had poor performance.

Modern deep-learning based models on the other hand, doesn’t depend on given knowledge because it can continue learning on its own, constantly optimizing itself by adapting to changes and hidden patterns, resulting in incomparably better performance compared to the rule-based one.

#2. Safety: Your wearable will make sure you don’t miss a thing!

Smartphone manufacturers are constantly producing wearable and accessories to upsell with their smartphones.

Among them, wireless earbuds, since the launch of AirPods 1, have been a huge hit, and report says Apple alone has sold nearly 60 million AirPods. Airpods users love the Noise cancelling function, introduced with AirPods Pro, “cancels” the external sound before it could make you feel as if you are isolated from outside world.

While it’s a cool function, noise cancelling presents high risk of accidents by nature. If you are a cyclist or drive frequently, chances are you have encountered a passenger with earbuds who’s totally unaware of your bicycle bells or car honks. Some states in the US have introduced laws to forbid drivers to wear headphones or earbuds while driving.

Aware of this danger earbuds could bring, earbuds makers have been devising ways to avoid this danger. Google’s Pixel Buds have brought Attention Alerts in August 2020. If a baby cries nearby or an emergency vehicle passes by with its siren on, the Pixel Buds will automatically lower the volume temporarily so you can hear what’s happening around you.

Additionally, Apple Watch added another creative and well-timed safety measure amid the pandemic — the hand washing timer. With this feature enabled, Apple Watch listens for water running sound, and will automatically display 20 seconds countdown for proper hand washing.

#3. Accessibility: Designed to assist with your daily lives

Hearing loss is a common problem caused by noise, aging, disease, and heredity. Globally, there are 466-million people suffering from some level of hearing loss.

Hearing loss hugely impacts daily life in many ways. Take for example, sounds they are likely to miss out due to hearing loss — when you forget to turn off the water faucet, you can’t hear the constantly running water. No beep from the oven telling you your food is ready. Can’t tell if the smoke alarm went off. Missing out their babies crying, murmuring, and giggling… all these are huge pain they have to live with.

These people could hugely benefit from the sound detection technology if their mobile devices could capture the sound for them and give them notifications. Apple and Google were the first to add this feature into their smartphones, and users can configure sounds they want to detect under Accessibility setting — iOS 14 Sound Recognition (updated in September 2020) and Android Sound Notifications (updated in October 2020) respectively.

iOS users can set their devices to constantly listen for 11 sounds and receive alerts when these sounds are detected.The sounds are categorized as follows:

•Alarms: Fire, Siren, Smoke

•Animals: Cat, Dog

•Household: Appliances, Car Horn, Door Bell, Door Knock, Water Running

•People: Baby Crying

Android users can likewise detect 11 sounds including shouting and landline phone ringing.

Tech companies see accessibility as one of its core values and they put in a ton of work in assistive technology in order to ensure everyone can use their devices in the best ways to suit them. Some accessibility features such as VoiceOver (screen reader) or Voice Control, originally designed and developed with accessibility in mind, were adopted by mainstream after many people found value in these features. Sound detection too, will turn out to be useful for many people in general if smartphones could recognize diverse sounds and help them understand their surroundings better.

Progressing towards a smarter future

As it’s a growing market in the early stage, tech giants saw huge potential in the sound AI technology and started in investing in the field.

World’s largest annual workshop in the sound AI research field, IEEE DCASE (Workshop on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events), which used to be a flagship event mainly for academia, recently gained FAANG’s attention. In 2019, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and IBM sponsored DCASE, and Apple joined in the following year.

Predominant application for sound AI technology until now would be a simple sound recognition, like what Apple, Google and Amazon has built so far. What’s bound to come in the next few years however, is much more than that.

Researchers have spent a great deal of time studying how electronic devices can be augmented with sensors that allow them to perceive their environment. This body of work, often referred to as context-aware, stems from the idea that in order to build large-scale ubiquitous systems, individual devices must be aware of their environment (e.g. where they are, what is happening, where something is happening). Based on such information, applications and devices can make decisions proactively.

Sounds provide countless contextual information. Imagine what it would be like if devices could process perceive their surroundings by sound. Your cars could tell whether you are passing by a highway or crowded street, or forest surrounded by birds chirping, and change driving mode accordingly. Security cameras catch violent noise and spot a crime. Smart lamps knows you fell asleep and turn off the light. Autonomous car, smart city, home automation and healthcare — expansion of context-aware sound applications could be exponential.

With the speed of the research advancement in the field, context-aware sound applications will boom in the very near future.

5 ways to hack your workspace,"ew things affect our productivity as much as what we surround ourselves with. Yet most of us rarely take the time to step back and really analyze our working environment.

Instead, we take a ‘set it and forget it’ approach to where we work.

We go to the same office, the same coffee shop, the same co-working space and try to force ourselves into a productive flow. Since going remote a year and a half ago while working at Crew I’ve fallen into this mindset more times than I’d like to admit.

So I started to ask: If we’re going to spend so much of our lives working, why not try to make the place we work the best it possibly can be?

Whether you’re at home, in a shared space, or hanging out a coffee shop there are quick and easy fixes to help make your work space work for you.

Why our environment matters (even when we don’t notice)

You may think that you’ve got a good set up, but read into the ways that our surroundings affect us on a subconscious level and you’ll start to feel pretty uneasy about your environment.

Studies have shown how our working habits, both good and bad, are often related to some sort of external trigger or cue, which researchers are increasingly tying to our surroundings. We visit the same places, work at the same desk, and are constantly surrounded by the same influencing factors.

Which is great, right? Find a good working environment and you’ll be forced into a state of flow. But unfortunately, like most things to do with how our brains work, there’s so much more beneath the surface.

As we evolved, our subconscious brain has been trained to keep us safe, even when we don’t realize it. When we’re under threat we need to make decisions quickly, which our brain does through something called ‘thin slicing’. This means it takes one small element of reality and generalizes it, and from that it will determine what behavior to adopt.

So those triggers and cues in your workspace aren’t just affecting you in a way you can consciously comprehend, they’re changing the way your subconscious brain thinks and acts.

Don’t believe me? Here’s some studies that show just how ridiculously powerful our environment is in changing the way we think and act:

Students holding a hot cup of coffee for a few seconds before being asked to judge a hypothetical person, were more likely to describe them as warm and friendly than those holding an iced coffee

People will behave more competitively if there’s a briefcase in sight — or even if there’s a picture of a briefcase on the wall. And this happens even when people have no conscious memory of having seen the briefcase afterwards.

If you talk to someone who consistently uses words like down, depressed, low, pointless, and disappointed you’re likely to feel the same way

Even the subtle aroma of cleaning liquid in the air causes people to be perceptibly cleaner and tidier than usual

So how do we create an environment that’s optimal for making us feel the way we want to during the working day: motivated, productive, and creative?

Kill the clutter before it kills you

There is a long history of creatives and thinkers with cluttered desks. As Albert Einstein once so eloquently put it:

“If a cluttered desk signs a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?”

However, whether it’s your closet or office desk, excess things in your surroundings can have a negative impact on your ability to focus and process information.

That’s exactly what neuroscientists at Princeton University found when they looked at people’s task performance in an organized versus disorganized environment. The results of the study showed that physical clutter in your surroundings competes for your attention, resulting in decreased performance and increased stress.

A team of UCLA researchers recently observed 32 Los Angeles families and found that all of the mothers’ stress hormones spiked during the time they spent dealing with their belongings.

Similar to what multitasking does to your brain, physical clutter overloads your senses, making you feel stressed, and impairs your ability to think creatively.

However, it’s not as easy as just getting rid of the excess things in your life. We don’t create clutter simply through laziness or being unorganized, it literally hurts your brain to give them up.

Researchers at Yale recently identified that two areas in your brain associated with pain, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula, light up in response to letting go of items you own and feel a connection towards:

This is the same area of the brain that lights up when you feel physical pain from a paper cut or drinking coffee that’s too hot.

Your brain views the loss of one of your valued possessions the same as something that causes you physical pain.

So what do we do to reduce the stress of clutter?

Apply constraints: Whether that’s Twitter followers, tabs open in your browser, notebooks, or magazines, setting hard limitations and sticking to them is the best way to stop accumulating more.

Whether that’s Twitter followers, tabs open in your browser, notebooks, or magazines, setting hard limitations and sticking to them is the best way to stop accumulating more. Use small storage spaces: Parkinson’s Law says we fill the time we have available to us, and the same could be said about clutter. Less room means less room for clutter.

Set time aside to clean, sort, and discard every single month. Set up a daily cleanse routine: Crew CEO Mikael suggests cleaning your desktop at the end of every workday so to-do items don’t linger and you’ve got a clean slate to start with the next day

Find places that inspire you

There’s a reason we feel inspired by large spaces or refreshed from sitting by the window. Apart from a heavy dose of Vitamin D, architecture can have a huge impact on our productivity.

Author James Clear gives the example of researcher Jonas Salk, who, after spending years trying to discover the cure for the polio epidemic ravaging the US in the 50s, travelled to the quiet hills of central Italy where he stayed at a 13th-century Franciscan monastery known as the Basilica of San Francesco d’Assisi.

The space changed the way he thought:

“The spirituality of the architecture there was so inspiring that I was able to do intuitive thinking far beyond any I had done in the past. Under the influence of that historic place I intuitively designed the research that I felt would result in a vaccine for polio. I returned to my laboratory in Pittsburgh to validate my concepts and found that they were correct.”

Jonas’ example is just one of many.

It’s been long known that schools with more natural light provide a better learning environment for students and test scores often go up as a result. And natural light and fresh air are known to stimulate productivity in the workplace as well.

You might not be in a position to choose your workspace, but there are quick fixes: look for a spot with natural light from a window or skylight; take a walk outside when you feel stuck; or simply explore a new location.

A new environment can quite literally lead to new ideas. And what’s even more exciting is that studies have shown it’s actually easier to build new habits in new places.

Use different places for different places of mind

We know that different locations will affect us, so why not use that to our advantage?

Our brains love habits, and if we can associate certain qualities with different places, it can help us get into a better working flow. This is called ‘task association’, where your brain knows that when you’re in a certain place, you’re taking a certain action.

Writer Gregory Ciotti gives one great example of how he forces himself into a better working flow just by changing the device he’s using. In his example, he’s trained his brain to know that when he’s at his desktop it’s time for deep writing like articles. The laptop is for more shallow work like emails or informal posts. And lastly, the tablet is for reading only.

This technique is so powerful it’s even been used to help treat people with insomnia by telling them to only go into their bedroom if they’re actually tired. If sleep isn’t achieved in a reasonable amount of time, they were instructed to leave and move onto another task until they were tired again.

If you can set up multiple workspaces for different tasks you’ll also be able to force your mind into a certain flow, just by physically being somewhere.

A great example of this is writer and artist Austin Kleon who keeps two desks setup in his space: an ‘analog’ desk filled with paper, pens, and markers; and a ‘digital’ desk with laptop and tablet. Idea creation and ‘playing’ takes place on only the analog desk, while shaping, editing, and publishing is in the digital domain.

Set yourself up for success

We may think we have the willpower and control to push through harder tasks, but deep down we’re all lazy. But it’s not entirely our fault. Our brains have been taught to conserve energy at all costs and make subconscious decisions for us based entirely on how hard or easy it is.

So if you want to create a workspace that’s productive, focus on making it easier to do the things you want to do, and harder to do the tasks you don’t.

Stanford professor and psychologist BJ Fogg calls this ‘designing for laziness’.

Sometimes it’s as easy as turning your phone off and putting it in a drawer so every time you’re tempted to check it you have to go through a lengthy process, while other times it might mean unplugging your TV and putting it in the closet.

One technique I’ve used lately is to close all of my tabs in my browser at the end of the day (a hellish chore for any writer), leaving only my most important task open. The next day, the easiest choice is just to keep working on whatever was left from the day before.

I’m certainly not the first person to use this technique. Even Hemingway used to stop writing mid-sentence so that he always knew where to pick up the next day.

Curate your senses

Beyond the physical layout and mental associations of your space, there are some auxiliary things you can also control. The sounds around you and the music you listen to can have a huge impact on your productivity.

We’ve written about the power of music and how to find the right track for the right task before, but it’s important to note that certain sounds can be incredibly harmful to how you work.

Studies show that of all things, intermittent speech — hearing small snippets of conversation — can have an incredibly negative impact on your ability to concentrate.

One meta-analysis examined 242 studies of the ways noise affects performance, and found that when it came to performing cognitive tasks — like staying attentive, reading and processing text, and working with numbers — performance was more affected by intermittent speech than by either continuous speech (which would have little variation in volume and rhythm) or non-speech noise.

Bad news for those of us in shared spaces or offices.

There are options though. If you can’t find a spot that’s silent, noise cancelling headphones or music that drowns out speech can help regain that focus.",https://medium.com/swlh/5-ways-to-hack-your-workspace-c75bac5b0269,Jory Mackay,2017-11-23 23:23:54.093000+00:00,"Remote Working,Productivity,Psychology,Startup,Creativity"
You Should Be Writing,"So many of the questions that these writers have can be resolved with this simple two step process:

Read a lot of things. Going off what you’ve read, write.

How do you format a novel? Read a novel, and follow the formatting that they use.

Do you use paragraph breaks whenever a new character starts speaking? Crack open all of the books around you, and see how many of them do that. Chances are, most of them do. So it’s a pretty good idea.

How do you write a good starship captain? Go to Netflix, start watching Star Trek: The Next Generation, and start writing.

Okay, that one was kind of facetious. (Not really. Picard is the best.)

But still, you go out and, throughout your life, you observe things. You read books that are formatted correctly. You read novels and watch movies and TV shows with tingly, tense scenes. You watch all of the starship captains and you decide which ones are good (Jean Luc Picard and Kathryn Janeway) and you make your captain have some of their traits, and some traits from people that you admire, and you have them respond to the stresses of your story and you watch them play.

You write. And, probably, write poorly.

But then you read more and watch more, and learn more. You grow as a human being. Maybe you take some writing classes. Maybe you get some help from a published writer, who’ll leave helpful notes, like this actual note I got from actual author Heather Petty, on my first novel:

But none of that happens until you actually write the damn thing.

So you put the Quora away. You swallow back the worst of your questions — no matter how hard it is. No matter how much you want to do it right on the first time.

That’s right. You procrastinate on those questions. You kick them down the line.

You stop worrying about it. And I know that’s not an easy or passive thing. You have to continually stop worrying about it. You have to stop going back and revising and trying to make it perfect. You try to get it done.

Increase Your Reach by Differentiating Your Images from the Crowd,"When it comes to images, using them throughout your blog posts can improve their overall look and performance.

Here are five major benefits why you should be adding images to your blog posts.

1. Posts with visuals are more appealing

A picture is the best way to create a positive first impression of your post. When your post is visually dull and lacks emotions, a lot of visitors will just leave your website without reading a word.

Visually attractive posts have more chances to create an emotional connection with readers. They look friendlier and more inviting to take action.

When you add images to your blog posts, you help create a “story” for that part of the blog. Visually appealing images keep your reader scrolling, and, as mentioned above, people are more likely to retain more information.

The right image can convey a strong message to a reader: a picture can be worth 1,000 words.

2. Blogs with images get shared more on social media

Social media marketing is a vital part of spreading awareness about your content and increasing traffic to your business blog and website as a whole.

When it comes to shared blogs on social media, articles that contain images actually get shared more, which can help drive more traffic to your site.

Statistics from Search Engine Journal reveal that:

Blog articles containing images receive 94% more views.

Tweets containing images are retweeted 150% more.

Facebook posts with images receive three times more engagement.

3. Another valuable skill to promote

When the number of bloggers keep growing so quickly, you need something that could make you more skilled than others.

You can actually learn to do some simple designing tasks and your blog could become a good place to practice. Create some custom illustrations for your posts and build a portfolio of your artwork samples.

Your readers might sooner or later notice that you create images yourself and they might eventually recognize you as a higher-profile blogger with some hands-on designing experience.

If you are selling blogging services, your customers would really appreciate hiring someone who is capable of creating custom images for them in addition to just writing.

4. Images break up text into digestible chunks

In the same way people use paragraphs to separate points and make it easier for the reader to digest, people use images to separate points and make the text easier to understand.

When they are presented with a wall of text, the first thing they’ll do is try and find another source.

Even if your wall of text isn’t as long as other people’s content if it looks too difficult to read, they’re not going to bother.

Think about the two blog posts. Even though the actual content is the same, the one with the images is infinitely easier to read and comprehend.

5. Images can help boost your SEO

Blog posts with appropriate images perform better in search engines.

One more hidden SEO benefit of images is that you can add alt text to them right in your content management system.

By following keyword best practices and adding your primary keywords to your alt text, you can boost your SEO. While readers aren’t able to see the alt text you add to each image, search engines continuously crawl all the text within your blog article — including alt text.

It is a good way to populate your post with some relevant keywords that give it more chances to be seen. Make sure you compress and resize images to optimize them for search engines and faster loading.",https://medium.com/the-innovation/increase-your-reach-by-differentiating-your-images-from-the-crowd-d12d16c4fddc,Esat Artug,2020-12-08 21:48:59.493000+00:00,"Writing,Marketing,Social Media,Productivity,Creativity"
5 Important Reasons Why You Still Need a Personal Website,"Setting up a website is considered necessary for a variety of reasons. Every day, more than 547,000 new websites are created. Most of these are business and service-related, whether for rolling out a new startup, publishing a professional blog, setting up an online store, or even to introduce a non-profit organization. But what about creating a personal website?

There are numerous benefits to setting up a personal website. In fact, creating one is considered a necessity for many categories of people, including entrepreneurs, professionals in digital, media, entertainment, and creative fields, and even hobbyists. Yet, many decline to claim their personal space on the web. Often, it is not as a result of lacking the expertise. After all, these days, there are many ways to create a website without having to know a single thing about website development.

The issue is more about seeing the value in setting up a personal website. For example, many people think being on social media is sufficient. Having accounts with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. does connect you with the rest of the world. But the truth is, most people still search for stuff on Google, which is where having your own website truly becomes important. Not convinced?

How to Make a Sticky Connection With Your Biggest Fans,"We don’t know where our first impressions come from or precisely what they mean, so we don’t always appreciate their fragility.

— Malcolm Gladwell

First impressions matter, of course. That’s why you’ll find all kinds of advice about how to put your best foot forward as a writer. How to make your work look its best. How to properly format it for whoever you’re sending it to, and for your readers.

But what comes next? First impressions, like Malcolm Gladwell said, might be fragile. But I think it’s worse than that. I think they’re often either transparent or slick.

Either readers don’t remember their first impression of us or they’re drawn in by something, but the surface of the impression is too slippery to stick to them if it’s challenged later.

The best we can hope for on first impression is that they’ll come back. Read a little more. Or maybe just think about us again, when a friend needs a book to read. Remember us when they see our name again.

It’s the second impression — the chance we get when someone comes back for a second look — that matters most. It’s our opportunity to make a sticky connection with them. One that will make them remember us.

How we manage those followers who actually become fans is so important.

I had this experience once.

There’s an author I really admire. I read his newsletter. I own all of his books.

I’ve bought every single thing he’s ever tried to sell me. And I’ve hand sold his stuff all over creation. My first impression of him was lovely. Shiny and slick.

I was going to be in his city a couple of years ago and we’re colleagues enough that I decided to email and introduced myself. I told him I’d love to buy him coffee.

He wrote back, several days later and said that he was sorry, but he’d have to decline.

Okay. He was under no obligation to meet me. His reply was polite. First impression intact.

One day, several months later, I checked my Amazon affiliate links and realized that I’d hand sold more than 100 copies of his books that month. I wrote him again and told him that awesome news, showed him proof, and said that since my audience obviously loves him, I’d love to interview him.

Could I send him a few questions via email that he could answer at his leisure?

He wrote back, several days later and said that he was sorry, but he’d have to decline.

The exact same email. Still polite, but now obviously a cut and paste, since I had two of them.

Now, intellectually, I don’t expect everyone (or anyone) to do what I want or I’m going to hate them forever. He’s a busy, famous dude. He gets to say no, period.

But I’m human and I can’t help that the tarnish is off the shine of that first impression. That’s just the breaks.

I started out feeling like this man’s work was mine, in a small way, because I loved it so much. I had a connection to it that made me excited to spread the news about it. I shared it with people who trust me to send them to cool stuff, because it was sort of like sharing something of mine.

I still appreciate his work, but it doesn’t feel like it’s mine at all anymore. I was a kind of cosmic-level fan. Pat Flynn calls that a superfan.

My second impression of this author wasn’t very sticky. I fact, my first impression was stickier. These days I’m more of a regular fan.

Here’s another experience.

I signed up for a program that I was excited about starting. It was an innovative kind of mastermind community that I’d never really heard of before. I’d been to a conference put on by the guys running the program and I was jazzed to be part of it.

My first impression, again, was pretty. Nice and shiny and slick.

The first couple of days were rocky. The program’s owner had a thing about Facebook. He didn’t like it. At all. But in the lead up the program starting, he’d started a temporary Facebook group for people to start to get to know each other and it was really active and exciting.

But then he pulled the plug on it — deleted it completely — and moved to a forum on his own site. The forum was far less interactive and more slow paced. It was a complete dud. So, first impression was spotty at best.

But then I got an email from one of the guys who was running the program. In it was a one-minute welcome video where the man addressed me by name, talked specifically about why he was happy that I’d joined his program and what he thought I’d get out of it and how much he was looking forward to what I could bring to it.

One little video and suddenly I felt connected to the program again. I was willing to wait through the growing pains with the forum, at least for a little while.

That forum, btw, was the program’s ultimate undoing I think. The momentum that started on Facebook never reignited. At least it didn’t for me. But, because the person who’d developed the program took the time to make a good second impression on me, when he had something else to offer years later, I was excited to take a look.

My second impression here was sticky. Even though the first thing I did with them didn’t work out, they’d made a fan.

It’s the same for all kinds of marketing. Even for writers.

We have the chance to make a first impression, of course. We put our work out there. People read it and they enjoy it or they don’t. They share it or they don’t. They tell their friends about it or they don’t.

We put our best foot forward and aim for those good, shiny first impressions.

But it’s the second impression that matters even more. The second impression is what’s really at the heart of marketing for writers. Those readers who are intrigued enough to come back or to reach out for a little more — they want to be inspired. They want a sticky experience.

If you give them a chance, they’ll become your fan.

Most of your readers won’t give you the chance to have a sticky second-impression interaction with them. That’s okay. It’s the way the game is played. Most will read and move on, and you’ll never really know they were there beyond some statistic maybe.

If you think of your readers arranged in a pyramid, casual readers who only read something if they happen to come across it are at the bottom. A nice, sturdy base.

But some will seek you out on social media. Or they’ll join your email list. Or they’ll look for your next book. They’ll talk to a friend about what they read. They’ll ask a question.

There’s this advice about social media that says that you shouldn’t follow as many people as follow you. That you need, I suppose, to give the impression that you’re popular.

But I always remember that when my older daughter was in middle school and Twitter was a bright new thing, her favorite author followed her. Meg Cabot (or probably her assistant) followed my kid and she was over the moon.

And you know what? She still loves Meg Cabot. And you know what else? I still love Meg Cabot. She made my daughter a reader on a whole other level. That one little follow garnered her two deeper connections with readers than she would have otherwise had.

That was long before I had any published books, but I realized then that I wanted to make people feel the way Meg Cabot made my daughter feel that day.

So, what does it all mean?

I think it means, for writers, that you can read all the advice and strategy guides and tip listicles there are — and none if it will really matter if you’re not making a connection.

You don’t necessarily need to make a personal, one-on-one connection with every reader. I mean, you’re only one person. But you can remember that your readers are people who have chosen to spend their free time with you.

You can throw away the adages about how many people you should follow.

You can pay attention to your readers, so that your work becomes a conversation with them, instead of you pontificating and getting upset when no one listens.

When I think about sticky novelists, I think about Meg Cabot following my kid on Twitter. And Chuck Palahniuk teaching me about thought verbs. And Stephen King’s letters to his Constant Readers. I think about Ellen Hopkins traveling all year long to schools to meet her young readers.

I also think about Ray Bradbury and Octavia Butler and Judy Blume and a hundred other authors who told stories that invited me in. And that’s harder to do, of course. Way harder than following someone on Twitter. But it’s what I meant about being in conversation with your reader.

It wasn’t the first impression that mattered to me the most for any of those writers. I don’t remember which Judy Blume book I read first. Freckle Juice, maybe. But I will never forget reading Tiger Eyes when it was brand new in 1981. It was the first time I ever read anything that made me think — oh, my god, this author knows me. I was ten years old.

I’ve bought all of Blume’s books for my children. I’ve shared them with young friends my entire adult life. My daughters and I stood in line for hours to meet her at a book event and it was worth every minute. She made a sticky impression on me in the sixth grade.",https://medium.com/the-write-brain/how-to-make-a-sticky-connection-with-your-biggest-fans-47126c3c56dc,Shaunta Grimes,2019-09-24 18:54:46.456000+00:00,"Creativity,Writing,Fiction,Productivity,Marketing"
The Innovation Submission and Design Guide,"2. Formatting

Medium has published a great guide on how to format your title.

At The Innovation, the sequence of the three first element the reader sees when opening your article is this: (1) Title, (2) Subtitle, (3) Cover Image

Please keep them in the right order.

Here is an example of the right sequence of title, subtitle, and cover image we’re looking for:

Image by Author

Title

Only the first line of the story is considered the title. Select the text and click the large “T” icon to format the title.

Capitalize your title, meaning minor words are typed in lower case with all major words being capitalized. You can use Title Case Converter to adjust titles.

Write quality headlines. Here are some tips from Medium:

Be specific. Don’t leave the reader to guess what your piece is about.

Don’t leave the reader to guess what your piece is about. Spark interest. Engage the reader’s interest by highlighting what’s unique about your piece.

Engage the reader’s interest by highlighting what’s unique about your piece. Be clear. Avoid confusing terms, general statements, or “insider” jargon.

Avoid confusing terms, general statements, or “insider” jargon. Be clean. Watch out for typos in your headlines and please don’t use profanity.

Watch out for typos in your headlines and please don’t use profanity. Go for reads, not clicks. Steer clear of clickbait headlines — tropes like “one weird thing” or using “this/that” to get the reader to click. Make sure your story backs up the claim in the headline.

Steer clear of clickbait headlines — tropes like “one weird thing” or using “this/that” to get the reader to click. Make sure your story backs up the claim in the headline. Bigger is not better. Make sure the caps lock is off. No all-caps titles.

Here are a few great headline examples:

Elon Musk Wants You To Merge With Your Technology

Here are a few not-so-great headlines:

On Headlines

Mom

To Be a Perfect Person, Do This One Simple Thing

Subtitle

Writing directly below the title is considered the subtitle. Select the text and click the small “T” icon to format the subtitle.

For your subtitle, use normal sentence case: Only capitalize the first word and any proper nouns

Here is an example of a title and subtitle format we’re looking for:

Image by Author

Please do NOT include a link in the title and subtitle

Please do NOT write your title and subtitle with all capital letters

Submissions must have a clear and descriptive title and subtitle — they’re the first thing a user sees when viewing a story.

Please keep your title, subtitle, and cover image in the right order

You can use Title Case Converter to adjust titles and subtitles

Note: Changing a title or subtitle in the content of an article does not ensure it updates the SEO title and description. Be sure to update in both places. This article helps clarify Medium’s SEO options and settings.

Cover images

In The Innovation, all stories have a cover image that follows the title and subtitle.

Always include a high-resolution image at the top of a story under your headline. This has the following benefits:

When people share your story on social media, it will be more prominent in news feeds, making people more likely to click on it. It will look better in Medium’s own news feeds. Humans are visual creatures and click on images.

All images should be as wide as the text body of your article and ideally offer bigger sizes when you click on them in the editor — However, If you have a chart that is hard to read when it’s small, go bigger

Don’t use the widescreen or expanded formatting for images — keep them all in body-width, as shown in the example:

Image by Author

Technically as a writer, you are liable for copyright infringement, and Medium is not. The simplest way to attribute an image is to put the words “Image credit” below an image and link this text to its original source.

When you use an image, make sure you have the right to use it. If you are using an image you don’t have the rights to, that’s a copyright violation and disqualifies your story from curation.

All images in your article must show proper attribution to their respective source. Here is an example:

Photo by Jonas Jacobsson on Unsplash

Please credit all images properly as “Photo by,” “Image via” or otherwise doesn’t matter as much as naming the actual source of the image and linking to it.

Whenever you’re using your own pictures, simply add “Image by Author, Picture by Author, Image Courtesy of the Author, or Screenshot by Author” as the caption.

If you’re looking for images you can safely use without permission, check out Pexels, Unsplash, or search Google for images labeled for Creative Commons licenses.

Please make sure you actually have permission to use the image

have permission to use the image Stick with a simple, relevant image that relates to the main message or core theme of your post.

Section headings

When possible, submissions should be split into well-organized sections using correctly formatted section headings.

In every post, you should only have one “Heading 1,″ your post title. Use “Heading 2” for the main subheadings that support the title of your post. If you use “Heading 3,” those subheadings should support the “Heading 2” topics they’re under.

Here’s an outline for properly formatted headings:

Image by Author

Creating lists

Bullet Points — To begin a bulleted list, go to a new line, type in a dash (-) or asterisk (*), and press Space. Next, you start typing your first item. Once you hit Enter on your keyboard, the list will be reformatted for you automatically.

Numbered List — To begin a numbered list, go to a new line, type in 1. (numeral one, period), and press the space bar on your keyboard. The list will automatically add subsequent numbers when you hit Enter on the keyboard.

Mentioning Medium users

Type “@” and then the name of the person you want to mention. Mentioning someone will link to their profile and send them a notification when you publish.

Image alt text

This text helps screen-reading tools describe images to visually impaired readers and allows search engines to better crawl and rank your website.

Whether or not you perform SEO for your Medium articles, optimizing your article’s image alt text is your ticket to creating a better user experience for your visitors, no matter how they first found you.

How to Add Alt Text to Your Medium Article Images:

For an existing article, click the “edit story” tab in the upper right-hand corner. Click on the image you wish to add alt text to. Click on the “Alt-text” button. Write a brief description of this image for readers with visual impairments or to optimize SEO. Click the “save” button and you are done.

What Cycling Across Canada Taught Me About Starting a Writing Business,"I biked across Canada in the summer of 2017.

I had just finished my master’s degree, which was a very challenging experience — and not really in a good way. As I was finishing my thesis, I decided I needed to do something to recover. I wanted to do something difficult, but I didn’t want to think too hard. I didn’t want to rely on other people for my success. I wanted to get out of my head and into my body.

So I bought a bike and started pedalling.

Between June and September, I cycled 7,400 kilometres (about 4,600 miles) from Victoria, British Columbia to St. John’s, Newfoundland.

Then, a few years ago, I started a freelance writing business. Riding 7,400 kilometres across the country seems like a very different endeavour than creating a business, but a lot of the things I learned from my bike tour have actually helped me with both my writing and figuring out how to create a business from scratch.

Here are a few of those things.

Your Best Ideas Come When You’re Moving

Photos by the author. Left: Thunder Bay, Ontario. Middle: A highway rest stop, Alberta. Right: The Cabot Trail, Nova Scotia.

The two months I spent on that bike were the most creative two months I’ve ever had. It was a free flow, idea after idea, for five hours a day.

There’s lots of research to support the idea that exercising helps us be more creative. But I didn’t realize how powerful the effect of exercise really was. As soon as I was on the bike, I found myself solving problems, making connections, and generating ideas.

I use this as a practice all the time now with my writing. When I’m stuck with something, I go for a walk, go to the gym, or even do housework. (I actually had the idea for this article while I was washing dishes.) It’s productive and it helps ignite creativity.

Keep a Journal (Even When You’re Tired)

Your best ideas may come when you’re exercising, but they will also disappear if you don’t capture them.

I learned about disappearing ideas the hard way. Everyone asked me if I was keeping a blog for my trip. I sort of did, but I was very haphazard about it. Now that I write blogs for a living, I’m kicking myself for not taking it more seriously.

I took notes occasionally, but not nearly as many as I should have. After cycling all day, setting up camp, making dinner, and washing my shorts, I just wanted to lie down. I felt too tired and told myself I would do it tomorrow. But then, I would be busy in the mornings making breakfast, packing up, and trying to get an early start. And then I biked all day. There never seemed to be time.

I forgot most of those ideas that I had while I was biking. When I look back, I see that I wasted so much of the creative opportunity that I had simply by not taking notes.

So the lesson for me was to journal regularly. Now I keep a journal by my bed and a file in the notes app on my phone for random ideas. I also have a proper journal where I usually try to write an anecdote or two about my day. And I’m disciplined about it — even when I’m tired, I try to write at least one short story. The five minutes I spend jotting down my ideas will absolutely be worth it later.

Some Tools are Essential —and Some Aren’t

Photos by the author. Left: Lake Louise, Alberta. Right: Vancouver, British Columbia.

There’s a whole culture around biking equipment. When I started, I had no idea what was important and what wasn’t. People give different advice: Some say disc brakes are essential because they stop the fastest; others say you want V-breaks because they can be fixed anywhere. Some people say you need to have front panniers to balance the weight on your bike properly; others say they make your bike too heavy. Virtually everyone will tell you that you need cycling shorts.

I didn’t have a lot of money, so I opted for a minimalist version of all that. I used V-breaks because that’s what the bike I bought off Craigslist had. I didn’t buy front panniers; I just packed everything on the back and held it on with bungee cords. I wore regular basketball shorts.

Over time, I learned what was essential and what wasn’t. V-brakes are fine, as long as they work — but make sure they work. You don’t need front panniers, you just have to be okay with less stuff. But it turns out those sleek cycling shorts aren’t just for making your butt look great — they are actually designed to prevent saddle sores. (Ask me how I know.) They’re essential.

The lesson I took from my experience with biking gear was to find a basic system that worked and then to focus on cycling. Tweak as needed.

I’ve applied this strategy to my writing business, as well.

There are lots of people selling courses or giving advice on how to cold call potential clients, how to write blog posts that rank on Google, whether you need a website, and which grammar app you should use.

I still don’t have a lot of money, so I applied the same strategy that I did with biking: Start with something basic, focus on writing, and then adapt. I’ve been fine without expensive online courses, but a couple of SEO courses on Coursera were really useful. A website was essential. The free version of Grammarly is fine for me.

Find a system that works for you and then focus on writing. Tweak as needed.

Talk to Strangers

They’re so helpful. Strangers gave me information about the best bike routes, the best places to camp, and how to avoid bears. They gave me food and water. They gave me places to sleep. At a beautiful beach in Marathon, Ontario, this lady from New York and her Aussie boyfriend made me a meal on a fire and then left me with a bag of Chaga mushrooms. At a Tim Hortons in New Brunswick, a stranger came up and gave me $50 (he felt sorry for me). This lovely couple on Prince Edward Island made me and this other guy a full lobster dinner. At a lighthouse on the Cabot Trail, Moe and Elaine from Massachusetts invited me to stay on the extra bed in their trailer.

Cycling taught me that most people, most of the time, are really great. They will help you.

Writing is the same. It was only relatively recently that I decided to try to connect with other writers. I started with Reddit and I’m still getting into Medium, but in both places I’ve found other writers to be really useful. Writers have great advice. They share connections. They pass on leads. Joining a writing community has been highly beneficial for me.

Cycling is a solo sport, and yet it’s way easier with support. Writing is the same: You do it alone, but it’s somehow still way easier when you have a community around you.

Most of It Is Grunt Work

Photos by the author. Left: Schreiber, Ontario. Middle: Swift Current, Saskatchewan. Right: Morley, Alberta.

Cycling a really long way seems like it would be hard. But it isn’t really. To successfully cycle a really long way, you just have to consistently get on the bike and pedal. You do that over and over and over and, eventually, you’ll find that you have gone a really long way.

The cycling part is easy. But it’s an endurance sport — the hard part is doing it for a long time, over and over.

Writing is a lot harder than cycling. You can do it badly. (You can’t really do cycling badly.) So it’s not quite the same.

But here’s what they have in common: The trick to being successful is just doing it. You get on the computer, and you type for a long time, and when you do that enough, you find that you have written something. It’s not glamorous or magical; it’s grunt work.

Writing, like cycling, is an endurance sport.

You Are What You Do

There’s a strange kind of identity that comes with cycling. I never really thought of myself as an athlete, and certainly not as a cyclist. I’d never done much cycling at all, except as a way to get to school or work. I knew nothing about bikes themselves, the equipment, or cycling culture. (The first time someone asked me what kind of bike I had, my answer was, “a black one.”)

But once you’re on the bike, you’re a cyclist.

It’s the same for writing. If you are making money from writing — any money at all — you’re a writer. It helps to remember that when you’re finding it difficult and you feel a bit like an imposter. Like somehow you’re not a real writer.

Have you written something? Did you make money from it? Then you are a writer. Don’t worry about whether you’re a real writer. You are. Just worry about the writing.

Someone Is Always Better Than You

Photos by the author. Left: Emerald Lake, Alberta. Right: The Confederation Bridge, New Brunswick.

Everyone who saw the bundle of gear attached to my bike asked me where I was going. And it seemed like each of them knew someone who had biked across Canada better than me.

One person knew someone who did it in 50 days, which was 30 days faster than me. Someone prepared for a whole year before they did it. One couple didn’t prepare at all; they just bought a bike spur-of-the-moment while they were on vacation and started without a backwards glance. Another person knew someone who rode 400 kilometres in one day, in a storm with the wind at their back. Someone spent almost nothing on the trip. Someone else had no gear; he just carried a credit card and stayed in hotels. Some people I met were doing this for their second or third or 12th time. Virtually everyone knew more about bikes, the geography, the route, or the weather than me. There was always someone doing it better.

But in the end, I still got there just like they did.

Writing is the same. It seems like everyone is publishing articles about how they made six figures in their first year, or how to write a $500 article in 40 minutes. (Speaking of which, congratulations on $11,000 in 30 days, Tim!)

There are lots of writers (the majority of them, probably) who are funnier, smarter, and more interesting than me. Lots of people have written more. Lots of people publish in fancy places. They’re doing it better.

But I am writing for a living. I am certainly not making six figures, but I’m sustainable and paying off my student loans. I’m getting there.

The lesson is not to worry about whether you’re the best. You’re not. But you’re good enough. Keep pedalling.

You Make Your Own Journey

I met lots of people on the same journey as me. There was the new doctor on his sprint bike eating nothing but power bars. There was Mike, an ex tech CEO with his sturdy bike packed with 200 pounds of gear, slowly trudging away using peanut M&Ms for fuel. There was the vegetarian cyclist couple who were 17 years old and doing 250 kilometres a day, but who had one of their dads following behind them, carrying their camping gear in his truck. There was the 88-year-old woman doing it for the 12th time. There was Grace, the pole dancer, who mostly rode but sometimes hitchhiked (“Whatever. It’s my trip.”) and who determined her route in part based on Tragically Hip songs.

Each of these people had their own style and were on their own journey. Each one succeeded.

This can also be applied to writing. I’ve known people who were on many different journeys: Some became content writers after a career in journalism; others started writing after they quit their sales career. I have a friend who was a musician before specializing in product descriptions. My background was in academia and government where I wrote about research and its implications for policy.

People can help and give you advice, but each person’s writing journey is different. It’s a bit scary, but it’s empowering, too. Do your own thing.

Just Get Started

One of the most common questions I got leading up to the trip was what I was doing to prepare for it. I told people I was riding a lot, but actually I wasn’t. I rode the stationary bike at the gym for 20 minutes. I did that three times, total. That’s it.

The truth is that I didn’t really prepare at all. I had read a blog post (thank you affiliate marketing!) that said that the best way to prepare to cycle long distances was simply to cycle long distances. You could train as you go. Just don’t go too hard too fast and you’d be fine.

That was my strategy. The first couple of weeks were difficult, but I got through them. And then it was easier. To be fair, the first couple of weeks also had three mountain ranges, one of which was the Rockies… So.

The point is that the most important thing was to just start.

I’ve found that a writing business is the same. You can learn it as you go. Sure, it helps if you have some experience writing professionally and some knowledge of grammar rules. There are probably things you can do to prepare for starting a business — getting a legit website set up, doing some research, picking a niche, building a network. Maybe taking one of the many expensive courses that are out there.

But really, the idea that you need to be “qualified” to be a writer is a myth. You can learn to write as you’re writing. You just need to get started.

There’s No “Right” Way to Success

At first glance, cycling across Canada doesn’t appear to have a lot in common with starting a business. But here’s what they share: They are both big undertakings that can feel impossible at the start. And there are different ways to actually do them.

Lots of expert writers will give you specific tools, tips, and tricks that can help you write professionally or start a business. That can be helpful. But what I learned from my trip, and what I’ve applied to my writing business, is that there are lots of “right” ways to be successful. Use other people’s advice, sure, but don’t get overwhelmed trying to be a writer the right way. You can do it your way.

You’ve got what it takes. Take the guidance that’s useful to you, leave what isn’t. Try things out, experiment. And then work really hard at writing.

Optimizing Kafka for the cloud,"By Ambud Sharma | Software Engineer, Logging team

Takeaways

Developing locality aware systems and balancing algorithms can help substantially reduce cost

Making Kafka Producer and Consumer rack aware helps efficiently route traffic

Data-driven engineering decision making is critical to continuously improve systems

One of the fundamental principles when operating in the cloud is to ensure applications safeguard against outages. A common way to achieve this is to spread an application’s deployment across multiple failure domains. In a public cloud environment, Availability Zone (AZ) can serve as a failure domain. We can use multiple AZs to provide fault tolerance for an application.

Distributed systems like HDFS are traditionally made rack aware to improve fault tolerance by spreading replicas across multiple racks within a datacenter. However, using AZs as rack information is a common practice when running in cloud environments. This enables spreading data copies across multiple AZs, thereby providing fault tolerance in case one fails. While replicating data across AZs provides fault tolerance, it does come at a premium in form of AZ transfer costs.

At Pinterest, we use Kafka extensively as a scalable, fault tolerant distributed message bus to power several key services like user action counting and change data capture (CDC). Since we have Kafka running at a very large scale, we need to be mindful of AZ transfer costs and run as efficiently as possible, and so we focused on reducing the amount of data transferred across AZ.

When a Kafka cluster has brokers spread across multiple AZs, it results in three types of cross AZ network traffic:

Inter-broker replication traffic Traffic from Producers in different AZs Traffic from Consumers in different AZs

Out of the above traffic types we need 1 for fault tolerance. However, 2 and 3 are unwanted side effects that cause additional cost which, in theory, can be eliminated.

Design

There are two potential ways to solve this problem.

Approach 1

We can make our Producers and Consumers write/read data only for partitions whose leaders share the same AZ to make them more cost efficient.

Approach 2

Alternatively we could deploy AZ specific Kafka clusters, but in order to achieve this any other real-time consumers would need to make their business logic AZ aware.

In the interest of simplicity, we chose to go with Approach 1 since it minimized code and stack changes. Producer / Consumer AZ awareness can be achieved by looking up the rack information for the leader broker of the partition we are trying to read/write to, and change the partitioning logic for producers and assignments for consumer.

In Kafka, the broker’s rack information is part of the PartitionInfo metadata object that is shared with Kafka clients (both consumers and producers). Therefore, we deployed rack awareness to our Kafka clusters, where each broker publishes the AZ it’s in as node rack info.

We started this initiative with our biggest producer and consumer applications for Kafka, logging agent and S3 transporter.

Producer AZ Awareness

Our logging agent is responsible for reading data from log files and shipping them to Kafka in microbatches. The agent also lets users configure how logs are partitioned across a topic’s partitions.

One key design of our logging agent is the ability to pre-partition the data before calling Kafka’s producer.send(). This allows us to add more advanced routing. To make it AZ aware, we added ability for the logging agent to look up AZ info for the node it’s running on using the EC2 Metadata API. Next, we enhanced our partitioner to leverage rack information in Kafka’s producer metadata to limit writes to only partitions for which leaders are in the same AZ as the logging agent. (This change was only applicable to topics that didn’t use key based partitioning since ordering couldn’t be guaranteed after AZ awareness change, as a partition switches AZ.)

Consumer AZ Awareness

S3 transporter is responsible for reading logs from Kafka and persisting them to S3 for further processing. We tried something similar to the producer for S3 transporter.

Our S3 transporter doesn’t use Kafka consumer assignments. Rather, it uses its own partition assignment system. This allows us to preserve locality in case of node restarts or has temporary network isolation, thus reducing the amount of data that needs to be replayed for a given batch.

We make each S3 transporter worker look up and publish its AZ info to Zookeeper, which helps the S3 transporter master assign Kafka partitions to the workers based on their rack (AZ). If we are unable to look up the (rack) AZ information of a partition, we degrade to assignment across all available workers.

Results

We rolled out AZ aware S3 transporter to production, which resulted in more than 25% savings in AZ transfer cost for Logging. We’re currently in the process of slowly rolling out AZ aware logging agent to further reduce our AZ transfer costs.

We’re also working to extend this design to standard Kafka Producers and Consumers to help us extend our savings to other applications as well, which may include KIP-392 once it’s implemented.

"You Know What to Do With Your Life, You’re Just Not Doing It.","You Know What to Do With Your Life, You’re Just Not Doing It.

Just be honest with yourself.

I’m pretty sure you at least kind of sort of know what you want to do with your life. Maybe it isn’t crystal clear to you, but the foundation is there.

DNA is strange in that it just gives you your own unique set of characteristics. When you’re a kid, you’re just drawn to certain activities for no apparent reason. You develop tastes, inclinations, and desires.

During your upbringing though, you also develop fears. You’re taught fears. If left to your own devices, without learning about concepts like ‘being realistic’ or worrying about ‘risk’ you’d probably be more or less living the type of life you want to live.

I don’t blame you for going through the societal ringer and coming out the other side with a life you don’t want. That’s the default outcome.

I make no guarantees you’ll get out of it either. One of the hardest things to do in this life, in this society, is to be who you truly are and do what you truly want to do.

There are just so many incentives pointing in the opposite direction. If you want to stand a chance of making it out, you have to learn how to rediscover the real you and remember that you already know what you want.

Looking back at my past, I’ve always known I wanted to be a writer. I’ve been obsessed with words from a young age. I always had a great vocabulary without trying to have one. I’d write poems when I was in middle school.

I’d offhandedly mention wanting to write a book more times than I can count. I knew. Business always fascinated me. The idea of being free fascinated me. I was always curious about life and what it took to be successful. All the tools were there and I just had to pull the trigger.

The same goes for you.

You Already Know What You Want to Be, You’re Just Putting it Off

I remember this conversation I had with an Uber driver in Los Angeles on my way to the airport. She asked what I did for a living and I told her I was a self-improvement writer.

Of course, she began to tell me her life story and started asking me for advice. She was driving Uber because she was trying to earn extra money to solve this dispute over a debt or property taxes, something like that. She was frazzled and went on and on about how she didn’t know how to find a way out.

We talked about her past job experience, her potential dreams, options to get out of her bind. We kept going back and forth but never quite got to the root of the issue or a viable solution. She was hiding. This went on for an hour (L.A. has a lot of traffic).

As we reach the airport she mentions that she has this long track record of consulting experience and that she’d been offered deals to work with companies in the past. She says “You know, maybe I should start a business doing that.” In my mind, I thought “Yeah, lady, maybe you should.”

It’s a weird human quirk. We dodge the answers right in front of us. Why? Because it can’t be that simple, right?

If it is that simple, then you feel like an idiot for not doing anything about it. So you make up these complicated excuses for why you’re not doing the things you want because that explanation is easier to deal with than facing the truth upfront.

I have so many stories like this. Often I ask questions on my personal social media “What kind of business would you start if you were certain it would work out?” I remember once a friend of mine described her potential business to a tee — had the name and everything. I hope she starts it one day.

Hope you start your thing one day. Hope you don’t put it off forever — your bakery, your e-commerce business, your comedy career, your daycare, your jewelry shop in a tourist trap, whatever the heck it is, doesn’t matter, as long as you think it’s cool.

How do you overcome this fear that causes you to put things off? The process I use for all aspects of self-improvement is the same — diagnose the problem and try your best to come up with a solution.

The Path to Becoming a Doctor Requires Stamina,"Dr. Chris Meinzen is a hospitalist at St. Mary’s Hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado. He earned his bachelor’s degree in creative writing and neuroscience at Tulane University in New Orleans, followed by working at the Red Cross, and eventually by medical school also at Tulane.

How did you decide to go to medical school?

I was a little bumbling at that age. I liked school, enjoyed learning, and had some good friends going in that direction. My family encouraged me to try it out, and here I am 10 years later.

Did you consider other healthcare or public health tracks?

I didn’t, but mostly due to lack of exposure. I think the larger impact of public health is really interesting. I’m not sure I had ever really considered other healthcare tracks, though there are a lot to look at for sure. The physical and occupational therapists always seem the happiest in the hospitals. Maybe I should’ve thought more about that.

What was your medical school application experience like?

It’s hard to remember now. I remember a lot of checking and rechecking some kind of clunky electronic system. I hope that’s gotten easier to use.

What was your medical school experience like?

I loved my classmates at Tulane, we had a wonderful time. I think our professors did a great job teaching us and leading us to think both scientifically about our patients as well as see them as people with their own lives, social group, and preferences. It was a great time to work hard, learn a lot, and enjoy New Orleans.

What was your residency application experience like?

I researched pulmonary diseases in Peru with a group out of Johns Hopkins for a year before going to residency. That was fun, and a great cultural experience, but it did make applying to residencies back in the States a little more difficult. There’s a lot of flights, and skin-deep conversation. Ultimately I’m thankful for it because it brought me to our home here in Grand Junction.

What was your residency experience like?

Residency is also great, though maybe not so cheery as medical school. You have to work hard, but you can’t control your schedule. Less sleep, more work, more practical knowledge, more people wanting your time. It was probably good preparation for life after residency, but it was pretty exhausting while it happened. I happen to think that St. Mary’s Family Medicine Residency was exceptional at preparing me for my varied clinical roles now, and can’t be more thankful. I just don’t think I could do that again from a stamina perspective.

What advice would you give to people interested in becoming a doctor?

It’s hard to really know what that will be like for you. It’s worth shadowing a doc, and getting to know a day in the life of a med student and resident is like. It’s a good 6–10 years on the path. Ha, I guess I’m saying other people should give the decision a little more consideration prior to jumping right in like I did.

How did you decide what to specialize in?

I actually applied for residencies in 4 different fields, because I had a hard time limiting myself. There’s a variety of ways to become a hospitalist, ER doc, residency preceptor. Family medicine at my program was one great path, there are likely other good ones too. I was lucky to have great rotations in medical school to learn how much I like thinking deeply about both pathology (what’s going wrong with a body) as well as how people want to live. Fortunately, I have continued to enjoy that.

What does continuing education look like for a doctor?

Well, we have some minimum number of credits or hours to remain licensed. I don’t really know the number, but I probably do 2–6 hours a week, which I think is quite a bit above the requirement. At least I hope it is.

There are powerpoints and books and lectures and hands-on courses and ultrasound things. It’s pretty cool what all you can learn with.

What is your current role like?

I have two contract positions. I am a hospitalist at St. Mary’s Hospital, which is the regional medical center in Grand Junction. Hospitalists are the people who daily care for sick people stuck in the hospital. The other is working shifts as an ER doc in a critical access hospital in Fruita, Colorado, called Colorado Canyons. ER shifts are pretty much what you’ve seen on TV.

The last thing I do, mostly because I enjoy it, is precepting our local residents a few times a month. This is a whole different view of medicine, focusing on developing these residents while ensuring great patient care. The variety for me is really fulfilling.

What changes do you see happening in the near future in U.S. healthcare?

That’s a great question. Probably more suited to Congress than to me. We have the most expensive healthcare system in the world, and not the most effective one. I think the mix of requirement for insurance by legislature, employers controlling many healthcare plans, along with the requirement that hospitals take all-comers, makes for a lot of expense. On the back end, it can be hard for a lot of people to access appropriate healthcare, or even know what they’re getting when they do get in. I’m not a politician or really all that astute about healthcare policy. It does seem like it’s too expensive and hard to navigate for a lot of Americans, so I imagine that’s the ripe avenue for change.

What advice would you give to recent medical school graduates?

Well, if you’re graduating medical school then I hope you found a residency spot. I guess you’d be a few months in, ideally still in your high enthusiasm stage. That’s good. Don’t judge yourself when you get tired or worn out. Notice what helps you recharge, and cultivate those opportunities. Give grace to yourself, your colleagues, and your patients. We’re all human.

How to Silence the Haters in Your Head as You Write,"But then self-doubt crept in. I started thinking of all the potential readers who would disagree with my post and rage on me in the comments.

First of all, I don’t have a degree in psychology. What if people jumped into the comments and told me I’m not qualified to write about the topic? I had seen it happen with other people’s articles on narcissism, even though I had gained considerable insight and value from what the authors wrote.

Second, there’s a school of thought that says, we should love the narcissists for their flaws, and not speak badly of them. Well, we should also love the victims. Those of us who have experience can save potential victims years of confusion and frustration. Still, though, it was an argument I didn’t care to have in the comments section of a post.

Third, I worried narcissists themselves would get on the comments and rage at me, bash me, even threaten me. By exposing who they are and how they act, I represent a threat to their way of life.

Fourth and finally, I come from the southern U.S. where every discussion seems to turn into a matter of race. Would someone claim I am using a racist term by writing about “White Knight” narcissism (as compared to the classic “Dark Knight” type of narcissist)? I was just using the term coined by the expert, and I certainly never intended it to be racist, but I felt I had to be worried someone would interpret it that way.

How to overcome your self-doubt as a writer

Below are three strategies I used to overcome my fear of criticism. I went on to publish my article on White Knight narcissism, which has become one of my three most successful articles this month.

Your haters don’t know you; to them, you’re just a symbol

Haters, for the most part, are people who are going through life with an ax to grind. They’re going to spew their venom on someone. In this case, it just happened to be your post that supplied the necessary trigger they were seeking. If it hadn’t been you, they would have raged on someone else who unknowingly fueled their fire.

Look. If someone’s exposure to who you are is limited to a 5-minute article they read on a website, they don’t know you. Rather, you symbolize whatever perceived injustice gets them up on their soapbox.

When someone has a vast overreaction to what you have to say, they’re not telling you something about yourself — they’re telling you something about themselves. Specifically, they’re telling you that they don’t deserve even another second of your time, so close their comment without responding, take a moment to cleanse your energy if you feel the need, and move on.

If everybody likes you, you are doing it wrong. — Ben Michaels

What would your writing coach tell you?

What’s that? You don’t have a writing coach? Yeah, me neither. At least not one I can see.

What I’ve learned to do, and what I would advise you to try as well when you encounter resistance when writing, is to imagine your best future writing self 6 to 12 months from now. Imagine the writer who has many published stories and successes under their belt. What would that version of you tell you to do?

Do you really think that future self would tell you, “Naaah, don’t write that, there might be one person out there somewhere who would disagree with what you have to say. You wouldn’t want to offend them.” Of course not! So step into that best future self.

Credit where credit is due: I got the idea to check in with my future writing self from If You Ask Yourself This Question Every Single Day, You’ll Be Ahead of 99% by Sinem Gunel. It’s most definitely worth 4 minutes of your time if you need help getting unstuck.

Write for your biggest fans

Imagine that you have people out there who visit your profile page every day. They’ve come to see if you’ve posted anything new today, because they’re eager to read anything that you, one of their favorite writers, has to say.

What? You don’t have readers like that? Can you prove it?

Several times on this and other platforms, I have been pleasantly surprised to discover I did have those kinds of fans, and didn’t know it.

So why not write for them?

I’ll let you in on a little secret: If you write for those fans, even if you don’t currently have them, you soon will. Your enthusiasm will be contagious and people will want to read more from you. Doesn’t that sound like a better strategy than writing for trolls and haters?

In summary

Writers, like any other kind of human, are subject to bouts of self-doubt and fear of criticism. Not only is it hard to get unwarranted criticism out of your head, but it’s also easy to imagine future unwarranted criticism that can make you question whether you should publish some of your best work. Uncertainty presents the ego-driven mind an opportunity to fill in the blanks with things that could go wrong.

There are strategies, however, to silence the mind. If you worry about unwarranted criticism, realize the critics see you as a symbol and that they are commenting on themselves far more than they are you.

Learn to reach out to your best future self as a writer, to connect with that best version of yourself, and to draw on their wisdom for guidance.

Finally, imagine that you’re writing for your most dedicated fans, even if you think you don’t have any — you may be wrong, and if you don’t currently have such fans, you will soon if you keep expressing your best self.

5 Techniques I Use to Manage Stress as a Software Engineer,"1. Morning Journal

This is a technique I’ve been using for over three years, and it’s freaking golden.

Every morning, I write two things:

I do it every morning for 5-10 minutes, and by the end, I feel completely different. My mind is calm.

If you reflect and write everything you have on your mind (what you are stressing about), you will procrastinate less throughout the day and think less about that one problem you have.

The Four Types of Writing,"The Four Types of Writing

Each one serves its own purpose

Photo by Debby Hudson on Unsplash

There are four types of writing as an author. Expository, persuasive, narrative, and descriptive. Each piece of writing includes one or all of these.

Expository

Writing from an author to inform or teach the reader something. You will find this type of writing in articles like this one you are reading. The language and style are meant to explain something to the reader. For this article I am explaining the four types of writing.

Textbooks and how to articles will utilize expository in their wording. Even the recipes you use are a type of expository writing as the recipe tells you how to complete it. Newspapers are another example of this type of writing as the writer wants to inform the reader of the daily events taking place in their world.

Persuasive

Writing from an author to voice their opinion to persuade the reader. Persuasive pieces are most commonly found in speeches, scientific studies, medical journals and even political campaigns.

The term persuade means to convince someone else to agree with the argument set forth in the piece. Scientific studies and medical journals good concrete examples but this type of writing can be seen in advertisements, book reviews, editorials and brochures.

Narrative

Where an author tells a story, fact or fiction, to the reader. This type of writing is also called storytelling as it has a main character, there is a conflict the main character is workingout and an ending that resolves the conflict. With everything in the middle called the plot.

Fiction is considered narrative as it tells the story of the main character as they work through their conflict trying to find the resolution. Non fiction can be considered narrative as well because, even though the story is not made up, there is still a main character, conflict and plot.

Descriptive

A type of expository which uses visual descriptions to tell the reader a story. Usually includes scenery, emotions and actions in a way that will resonate with the reader, allowing them to visualize the story in their mind as they are reading. It’s primary purpose is to describe a person, place or thing.

This type of writing can be used in the other types of writings, as it pertains to painting a virtual picture for the reader. It is used in both fiction and non fiction. A good, clear attention is required to write in a way that interacts the five senses, sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch.

Final thoughts

5 Simple yet Effective Tips for Creating High-Quality Content for Your Content Marketing Strategy,"#4. Content happens frequently and consistently.

One of the toughest aspects of an effective content marketing strategy has nothing to do with the substance of what’s being communicated. It has to do with how much and how often you publish content.

The goal is to master the art of volume and consistency. It’s tough to do both, especially just starting out, so I find it best to start with the consistency aspect to start building the habit.

If you’re starting from ground zero on your content strategy, pick one or two avenues you want to focus on first. Let’s say you decide on company blog posts and thought leadership articles from your CEO. Pick an achievable goal based on your team capacity—maybe two 500-word blog posts, and one thought leadership article per week. Stick to that volume for six to eight weeks before implementing any other content marketing strategies.

Once you master that, you can either increase or expand your strategy. To increase is to continue what you’re doing but in greater volume. If your company blog posts and thought leadership articles are performing well, try adding two more blog posts per week and one more thought leadership article per week, or whatever’s manageable on a consistent basis.

Expanding is jumping into other types of content like podcasts or video interviews, leveraging other types of material to maximize output. For example, can you think of all the material you can create from one hour-long filmed podcast episode?

The video of the podcast can be uploaded to YouTube, and segmented into tons of small video clips for Instagram and TikTok. The audio can be used to promote as a podcast on Apple or Anchor.FM. The transcripts of the audio can be turned into multiple thought leadership articles or company blog posts, as well as short-form status updates for LinkedIn.

Of course, not all companies need to market on Instagram or YouTube, but expanding your strategy is always worth brainstorming internally to set yourself up with a plan to keep content ideas flowing.

At the end of the day, your preparedness is what’s going to keep you publishing on a frequent and consistent basis.",https://medium.com/swlh/5-simple-yet-effective-tips-for-creating-high-quality-content-for-your-content-marketing-strategy-88ed18271aa8,Jack Martin,2020-05-13 09:01:00.845000+00:00,"Marketing,Content Marketing,Writing,Business,Creativity"
Who Rules the Cloud Service: AWS or Azure?,"Amazon Web Service (AWS)

AWS is owned by Amazon and it is the number one cloud provider, according to the Public Cloud Share. That is the percentage of companies, the money involved in AWS is around 32% right now. So it is the maximum and that’s why AWS is the leader in the cloud industry for the past 10 to 15 years.

Microsoft Azure

Azure is owned by Microsoft, and it comes second only to AWS. They are second in the cloud race and they are again the same type of technology. So Azure is provided by Microsoft, but even then they are just a cloud provider like AWS.

Similarities between AWS and Azure

So both provide similar services, even though they provide similar services, they are two different entities owned by two different companies providing various services which are named differently. But their functionality is going to be the same. So I think you get the point that AWS and Azure are cloud providers owned by Amazon and Microsoft, respectively. AWS is the number one in cloud market share and Azure is number two and these two are the major cloud providers in the entire cloud computing industry.

AWS vs Azure

1. Launch Date

AWS launched in the year 2006 and Azure launched in the year 2010. So basically in technology years, 4 years is a very long gap and that is one of the main reasons AWS has captured a lot of businesses and are in the lead in the cloud computing race

AWS came into the cloud industry, but EC2 and S3 as the first projects of their first tools which were out for the public. And in 2010, Azure came up with basic services, like virtual machines, Azure storage, Azure database. So they came up with their own services.

2. Regions

AWS has 77 availability zones in 24 geographical regions across the globe. So these availability zones are the ones that have the physical servers, all the physical components which are required to launch service, database engines, or storage units. So AWS is the cloud provider that has the maximum number of availability zones in the world.

Why is availability zones really important?

Let’s say you’re from India, you’re launching an application in India and it’s very successful and your customer base is growing even out of the country. When that is happening, you want to expand your application to a global audience, and if you’re using an on-premise set up with your own data center, a small data center. So in this case, you’ll have to buy more servers to accommodate more users or you’ll have to buy the servers in whichever location or whichever country in which you are going to extend your application. You’ll have to buy a data center over there, or you’ll have to buy a location, buy a space and set up a data center. But instead of doing that, if you’re using AWS or if you’re using Azure, in that case, you can use their global infrastructure and set up your application anywhere in the world just by sitting in your own office. So we can do that across the globe and you can engage your application with the global audience.

Now, Azure has 60 different availability zones, but they are in 60 different regions, which is most by any cloud provider. So even though AWS was early in the cloud business, Microsoft was early in the tech business. Microsoft came into the tech business way before Amazon came into it.

So Amazon first launched as an e-commerce website, not a tech website or a website that provides cloud services. So Microsoft was already having a wide infrastructure across the world. So they were able to build their architecture accordingly. So their cloud infrastructure has grown across the globe in 60 different regions.

Why regions are important?

Let me give you a brief example. Over here in India, there are three different availability zones in one particular region, which is in Mumbai. But if you look at India in Azure, you can see West India, Central India, and South India. So they have three different available results in three different regions, which can be helpful for low latency in applications. So let’s say your application is mostly concentrated in South India, you can host it on the South Indian data center. If it is in Central India or if you want to concentrate on the whole of India, you can put in all the data centers. Or if you just want to concentrate on the north side of India or the west side of India, you can go ahead with the west or central India. The same goes for every single available zone or every single region available across.

So this is a difference. AWS has 77 Availability zones but in 24 geographical regions. Microsoft has 60 available zones lesser than AWS, but they have it in 60 different regions. That’s the main difference. Also at the beginning of 2019, AWS had 54 availability zones and Azure had 44 availability zones. So both of them have grown pretty wildly.

In 2021, AWS is planning to build 18 more availability zones in six more regions, and Azure is planning to get 8 more available zones in 3 more azure regions. So they’re still planning more regions.

3. Market Share

As a common person, it doesn’t matter. You can choose any of the cloud services which you want and you can start working on it and you can get a job in it.

But why do we talk about market share?

So let me tell you. First, whenever the market share for a particular business means a lot of businesses or a lot of companies are using that particular technology. So let’s say AWS if their market share or their spending on that particular cloud provider is high. In that case, a lot of companies are investing in AWS. So if a lot of companies are investing in AWS, that means you have an abundance of jobs in various companies. So if you go with AWS or Azure or Google cloud, you have a lot of companies who are working with them. You can get into a job with them.

According to Gartner Aws is the leading cloud service provider. So this means they are visionaries and they are leaders. So Microsoft, Google, Amazon services all come under leaders and visionaries. But the leading leaders are Amazon Web services and the leading visionary is Amazon Web Services.

4. Niche players

This means the cloud services providers play on their particular role. So Alibaba Cloud or Oracle or IBM or Tencent Cloud, they have their cloud services which can accommodate their own company’s infrastructure and the companies which are using similar services and that’s why they are called niche players. They only play in that particular area. They don’t move out of their expertise. But AWS, Microsoft, and Google are exploring the entire industry from healthcare, from retail to I.T. companies. So Every single place they have put down their staff.

5. Clients

Now, the top clients of Amazon Web Services are Netflix, Twitch, LinkedIn, and Facebook. So I think most probably, you know, these four different services at four different websites. So Netflix is the top media streaming platform in the world. Twitch is the top live streaming platform in the world. LinkedIn is the top job connectivity or job finding portal in the world. And Facebook is the largest social media network in the world. So four of these companies are using Amazon Web services for their cloud needs.

For Azure, the top spending companies or the top companies using are BMW, Twitter, Samsung, and eBay. Again, you would obviously know all of these companies. They are top companies who are using Azure for their cloud needs.

So if you are working well enough, you can get into these companies as a cloud architect or you can get into the previous companies, which I mentioned, Netflix, Facebook or LinkedIn or even eBay or Twitter. So you can get into these companies if you are a cloud architect or a cloud developer or an administrator or whatever it is, you can get into these companies and get a high salary.

6. Services

In AWS, the relevant service is EC2 and in Azure, it is Azure Virtual Machine. So both of these services provide a secure, scalable, and reliable compute capacity (i.e) A server in the cloud. You can create a server as per your needs on the cloud.

7. Storage

In Azure, you have to go to Azure blob storage. In AWS, you have to go to AWS S3 or AWS Simple Storage Service. So again, these two are similar services, S3 uses object storage to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Massively scalable and secure object storage for cloud-native workloads are archives and data lakes. So basically they are similar, just different explanations or different definitions for the same service, but they are provided by two different organizations.

8. Database

AWS has a Relational database service and Azure has SQL databases.

What is the difference between a relational database and an SQL database?

They both use SQL and they are both database engines. In AWS, set up an operate and scalable relational database in the cloud with just a few clicks. In Azure, built apps that scale with the pace of your business with managed and intelligent SQL in the cloud.

So basically you can create a cloud engine on both. You can create a database on the cloud which is scalable, so you can set it up as scaled automatically, so it’ll automatically scale up for you.

So in this case, they have similar services, the only major part is that AWS provides more services than Azure. AWS provides more than 150+ services right now, because, again, saying that they have a 4 years lead in the cloud computing industry, that’s why they are leading by a lot. Even Azure provides a lot of services, they provide 100+ services, not as much as AWS. So you can go with any of them.

In the year 2021, both of them are growing at a really fast pace and other cloud services are trying to catch up with them, but they’re not able to. AWS and Azure are still growing, so you can go ahead and take up AWS or Azure, there is no problem in taking up any of these cloud providers.

9. Pricing Structure

Pricing models are one of the important factors before considering the cloud tool. In AWS, you have a pay-as-you-go model completely. It means whatever you use, you’ll pay for that at the end of the month. So you’ll start with zero credit. As you use services, it’ll succumb up to a particular value or a particular amount of money which will be paying at the end of the month.

Even Azure has pay-as-you-go, you can opt for that or there are also subscriptions where you can take up subscriptions that have certain limits within azure. So you can use that credit limit to go ahead and use the Azure service, which you want.

For 4 vCPLUS and 16-gigabyte memory, the On-Demand Linux instance in AWS will cost you 0.1856 dollars. But the same type of instance in Azure will cost you 0.1690 dollars. So now, just considering these two values, they’re are quite small and there is not much difference, it’s just like 0.15 Or something like that.

But if you’re server is running for 24*7 and there are 100s of servers with the same specifications that will save you a lot of money if you’re using Azure in this case.

But again, there is one more difference. That is in AWS, you’ll get more discounts if you’re taking up a one-year reserved or a three-year reserved instance and that means you will get a dedicated instance, dedicated server, where you can run instances at any time, and that can save you 42% of the money and in Azure, it can save you around 36% of the money. So AWS could be cheaper for the long run Azure will be cheaper if you’re going to use On-Demand instances.

One more part is that in AWS, you’ll be charged by the hour, (i.e) even though you have used a particular service for just one-minute even in that case, you’ll be charged by the hour. So you’ll have to pay the hourly rate. But in Azure, you’ll only be charged the minute rate. So if you’re using only for two minutes, you only pay for the two minutes you have used. You will not pay for the complete half.

Future Predictions for the Public Cloud Infrastructure

According to Gartner, the cloud infrastructure will improve by 35% in the year 2021. That means the companies are moving towards the cloud-first approach than an on-premise data centre. It’s increasing every single year, so there is no surprise element here. I just wanted to show what would be the future of the cloud industry. So again, when the cloud industry is growing, I would suggest you to get into it, so that you can grow with the cloud industry.

So you can visit these two sites, (aws.amazon.com and azure.microsoft.com) this is basically for India. You can check out the news updates which are coming out for AWS and Azure. They are basically in the latest article at first, so whichever change has been made recently, that will be at the top and you will get to know more about the changes or the changes of services in AWS and Azure.

Why Word Placement Is Important in Headlines,"Why Word Placement Is Important in Headlines

Readers are attracted to the first 3 words and the last 3 words

Illustration by Cynthia Marinakos.

What you do when you’re confronted with emails and social posts each day?

How do you browse through news websites and Medium articles?

Do you click on each one?

Most likely, you skim through the headlines to get the gist of it without having to click each one. Only clicking on the ones that call out to you at that moment, if you’ve got time.

A Kissmetrics study discovered that users pick out the first three words and the last three words of a headline. Headline expert Bnonn recommends keeping a headline to six words so that readers can quickly understand it.

Copyblogger informs us that on average only two out of ten readers will read your article — eight out of ten will only read your headline copy.

That’s why it’s worth paying attention to word selection and word placement.

It doesn’t mean we need to stick to only six words, although I came across several sites with headlines that consistently hovered around six words.

For longer headlines, it helps to consider the first three words and the last three words.

“As a rule, if it won’t fit in a tweet it’s too long. But let me suggest that rather than worrying about length you should worry about making every word count. Especially the first and last three.” — Kissmetrics

This discovery fits into the concept of frontloading for headlines. This is where you place the most important words first, and we can complement that with also carefully selecting the last three words. It will also help your headline’s SEO by making sure your reader can find the keywords they’re searching for.

Let’s begin with examples of headlines with six words and six and more words where the first three words and the last three words have been carefully chosen. You’ll find helpful resources to help you with word selection. And finally, you’ll discover a simple way to assess your headlines.",https://medium.com/better-marketing/why-word-placement-is-important-in-headlines-5eccea7897e,Cynthia Marinakos,2020-03-07 07:05:01.446000+00:00,"Creativity,Business,Headline Hacks,Productivity,Writing"
8 Questions You Can Ask Yourself to Write Better Articles,"8 Questions You Can Ask Yourself to Write Better Articles

Uncover the blind spots that keep your articles from thriving

There’s no exact method for writing articles that people want to read. You can write about a variety of topics successfully if you understand the patterns behind the type of articles people want to read.

It sounds simple and obvious, but many new writers miss the point. If you want a lot of people to read your writing, you have to write the type of articles people actually want to read.

If you want to stop banging your head against the wall, feeling frustrated that your work is getting nowhere, focus on that simple truth.

You don’t have to write a certain way. You’re free to do what you wish. But, you also have to live with the results. I see far too many writers who blame their lack of success on the audience.

Josh Spector once said, “You can write for an audience or write for yourself, but you can’t do both.”

If you don’t want commercial success that’s fine. But too many writers want commercial success doing it their way when their way doesn’t work.

The choice is yours. But always remember the golden rule of writing. It’s never the audience’s fault.

You don’t have to write how-to articles and listicles to get ahead. You really don’t. But, your articles will perform better if you have the right answers to some of these key questions.",https://medium.com/swlh/8-questions-you-can-ask-yourself-to-write-better-articles-db2f04ade2c7,Ayodeji Awosika,2020-12-17 20:39:27.323000+00:00,"Marketing,Writing,Writing Tips,Creativity,Creative Writing"
The Future is Now,"Despite the terrible SARS-CoV-2 pandemic currently ravaging much of the world, we must try not to forget how far we have come as people of Earth in recent years. We also need to maintain an optimistic outlook as much as possible even in the face of truly challenging “black swan” events.

This past year has been a big one in terms of technological landmarks:

— IBM’s Q System One became the first commercially available quantum computer.

— A new synthetic DNA was created which doubles our current 4-letter code (A,T,C,G) to 8, allowing for greater possibilities in DNA computing. In another study, scientists injected a synthetic DNA into some E. coli bacteria. They survived, reproduced, and actually carried along copies of the synthetic DNA as well, offering proof that actual synthetic life can be created in a lab.

— Researchers put nanoparticles that react to infrared light into the eyes of mice, giving them biological infrared vision.

— In a massive project called the Event Horizon Telescope, astronomers linked powerful telescopes from all around the world to create a virtual mega-telescope with an aperture the size of Earth, and were able to image the black hole at the center of the Messier galaxy 55 million light years away.

— 3D printing of human tissue and organs can now be done without using the traditional scaffold model which acts as a support structure, allowing for more possibilities to save lives.

And these are only a few large new steps into a world that used to exist only in our imaginations.

What might happen in the 2020's?

Futurists and other prognosticators have been hard at work coming up with lists, so here is a short one of my own:

— AI creations will become nearly indistinguishable from the humans or animals they are meant to imitate.

— Cloning of humans and animals (extinct or recently deceased) will continue to be debated by worldwide authorities, while rogue scientists continue to actually do it. Expect to see a lot of reborn labradoodles and a real, live baby mammoth, or something similar, by 2030.

— While green power will keep getting more efficient and cheaper, the continued growth in developing nations will stall progress in declining greenhouse emissions.

— 3D printing, of everything from organs to electronics and housing, will become a cornerstone of modern manufacturing.

— Robots and drones will grow into a truly transformative cultural phenomenon, launching new types of entertainment and becoming commonplace in daily life.

— Quantum computing will lead to a doubling of all human knowledge between 2020 and 2030.

— Humans will walk on the Moon, or Mars, or both.

— Real, effective life extension therapies will become available, but only for the very wealthy. The rest of us will have to wait a while.

— The Internet of Things will grow into what everyone’s been envisioning for it: Complete inter-connectivity that enables greater productivity. However, the dangers of hacking will continue to loom over it.

Now, let me return to the now.

Looking back a little farther — but still fairly recent — SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, the largest ever, from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in February 2018.

Its cargo was a Tesla Roadster, which is now orbiting the sun somewhere between Mars and the asteroid belt.

Between Elon Musk’s numerous companies and passion projects (SpaceX, Tesla, Solar City, the Hyperloop, the Boring Company), and the quickly proceeding advances in VR/AR/MR, genetics/cloning, blockchain, AI, 3D printing, and other fields, someone who was in a coma since 1998 and just woke up yesterday would be forgiven for thinking they had jumped a hundred years into the future instead of a mere 20.

But then this person would actually get up and go out into the real world and see that mostly everything else is the same, aside from more traffic on the roads, more people in general, most of whom now carry miniature computers with them wherever they go that are more powerful than any desktop from the 20th century.

Elon Musk’s Grand Plan

Born in apartheid-era South Africa, he lived the first 16 years of his life in various towns, including Pretoria, moving back and forth between divorced parents. He reports being bullied in school and witnessing a lot of violence. He tried sticking up for some other bullied children, but that generally resulted in more pain for him. Musk retreated somewhat into science fiction and fantasy, and the dreams he read on the page would come to inform the man he eventually became.

He moved first to Canada to live with some relatives, and later earned economics and physics degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. He went on to co-found Zip2 with one of his brothers, Kimbal Musk, and Greg Kouri, which was acquired for $340 million. Next, he co-founded X.com, which became Paypal and sold to EBay in 2002 for one and half billion dollars.

Now very rich, Elon Musk turned his attention to those science fiction dreams.

In the short term: The environment has been poisoned at an ever-growing pace by the burning of fossil fuels for two centuries, beginning with coal and reaching a pollution peak as the massive population of China began using gasoline-guzzling automobile en masse. Musk’s contribution to helping slow this is multi-sided: popularize electric cars by offering visually appealing, efficient and powerful versions of them with Tesla. Invest in more solar power adoption via Solar City. Open-source a plan for super-fast commuter train transport with the electromagnetic vacuum-tube Hyperloop project. Invest in tunneling technology that can help move this project along with the Boring Company.

In the long term: There have been dozens of small extinction events on Earth since the dawn of life, and several that have wiped out 75–95% of all living things. It will happen again, and there is a good chance that a large event will take with it the vast majority of humanity. Because of this, Musk founded SpaceX with an ultimate goal of turning humanity into a multi-planet species. He’s funding this by creating reusable rockets that allow him to outbid competitors in taking cargo into orbit. The plan is to start a colony on Mars that will eventually be made self-sustaining. Ultimately, he thinks this can become home to a million people by roughly 2070.

In other words, Elon Musk wants to save us here and now, and also do what he can to save us for eternity.

All in all, this is both an ambitious and worthy cause.

There is nothing wrong with doing what you can to save people. Doctors, soldiers, first responders, they do this all the time.

And, in general, our governments don’t seem to be doing much to slow our pollution of the environment or protect us from future disasters. Yes, there has been some progress, but it is often mired in politics and red tape, and forward-thinking policies of one administration are often reversed by the following one. Our governments can barely protect us from rising sea levels and flu virii, let alone giant asteroid impacts.

So, someone has to do it. These grand efforts usually form around the resources of extremely wealthy individuals and take many forms. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for instance, focuses on the physical and mental well being of the youngest and poorest people. Kimbal Musk, one of Elon’s brothers, is using his fortune on a decidedly smaller scale in a quest to help reconnect us and our children in particular to a more natural, local and organic food culture.

Hope is both the strongest driving force and an impediment to progress.

Many people who grew up in the early to mid 20th century thought we would be living in some kind of fairy-tale sci-fi wonderland by now. Others posited it would be a dystopia, or that all that would remain of our world would be a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

We’re living in a time when dreams of generations past are becoming true on a regular basis. If a person born anywhere on Earth in 1899 were to be transported into the future, to right now, into a modern city, they would find a lot to recognize but they would also be mesmerized by the miraculous pocket computers most people carry with them and the contrails of giant flying ships miles above. Said person might even experience a mild cardiac infarction upon seeing evidence that we’ve landed on the moon and are beaming pictures back directly from the surface of Mars (and they might be somewhat disappointed that Mars wasn’t teeming with jungle life).

Advancements, just in the medical field, come at a nearly dizzying pace:

— 2016 saw the use of a drone to take medicine to a remote part of Rwanda. This will become more commonplace and will be a great boon to the treatment of medical conditions in isolated parts of the world.

— The 1.25 million (and growing) people in the U.S. who are living with Type I diabetes have a ray of hope in the form of a new artificial organ that is an implanted blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery device. Eventually this device will also be available for the other 28 million people in the U.S. who have Type II (adult onset) diabetes, and over 200 million diabetic people worldwide.

— Patients suffering from full-body paralysis, with functioning minds who are unable to physically speak — much like the late Dr. Stephen Hawking who lived with ALS and communicated via a keyboard text-to-speech system — will be able to eventually think what they want and have those thoughts become words.

The dreams and nightmares of our fictions have always pointed us to the truth of where we were headed. Echoes of George Orwell, Isaac Asimov, Ayn Rand, Jules Verne, Ursula K. Le Guin, Philip K. Dick, P. D. James, Arthur C. Clarke, and even Mary Shelley can be seen in our everyday lives. If we take what we have, examine the quickening rate of advancement, and extrapolate into the near future, we can easily believe that Ray Kurzweil’s singularity is right around the corner. An artificial superintelligence, almost as soon as it realizes what it is, will proceed to surpass humanity in every way, leaving us behind.

A super AI is one of the dangers Elon Musk sees as a potential extinction trigger, so it is likely his goals for a Mars colony will include keeping it rather well-separated in many ways from the civilizations of Earth. What good would his plan be, anyway, if he brought along to Mars the dangers that might doom us here on this planet?

There can be no light without darkness.

Just as with our development of atomic fission, which led both to the horror of atomic warfare and (relatively) clean electrical power for millions, every significant innovation seems to carry with it both extreme positives and extreme negatives. If we want TNT to help greatly increase the building of infrastructure, we must accept it will be used to kill hundreds of thousands of people. If we want safer, cheaper workplaces via robotics, we must remove millions of potential jobs from the marketplace. If we want the convenience of smartphones, we must deal with the repercussions.

One of the late Dr. Stephen Hawking’s common refrains was that the greatest threats to our existence come from the technologies that we’ve devised. In essence, by forging ahead we may well become our own downfall.

Newton’s Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal but opposite reaction. While this was meant to apply to the physical sciences, it has long since proven to be applicable in our daily lives.

What, then, might this mean for the ambitions of Elon Musk? Might splitting the human race across two separate worlds eventually lead to some Solar System civil war that devastates humanity as much as any cosmic or earthbound natural disaster would have? Could gaining a truly massive foothold among consumers with solar and electric car technology upend economies founded on fossil fuels and lead to more war?

Do we side with pushing onward despite the consequences?

The odds, based on history, are in favor of something bad being caused by every good intention. But without those good intentions in the first place, virtually no progress would have been made by our civilization over the past 500 years.

If you removed every major instance of innovation by humankind since the discovery that we could control fire, we would be living on an Earth that looked incredibly different. “We” wouldn’t be here. Humanity would amount to a few million individuals at most, living in bands and tribes on plains, in forested river valleys, along coastlines.

We would be safer, as a species, only because we did not dare to dream. By dreaming, we discovered there are risks, but we continued because there was always something to fix, something we could do better, somewhere else to go.

Elon Musk, and everyone who thinks like him, understand there are risks. In fact, they know that there will be some bad things, some complications, that arise because of their actions. But a choice had to be made between pressing onward versus sitting still, and they chose to face the darkness so that, at the very least, some light could be shed upon it.",https://medium.com/predict/the-future-is-now-c9ec1115a8d9,A.

The Secret Sauce Behind Your Productivity Playlist,"When I was in college, I used to write my papers in the music library. Not because I was studying music, but because the music library was literally under construction. The study rooms there were cubes of bare white cement — a jail cell, basically — with a desk in it. I liked (and like) working in complete isolation, but heaps of basically-inconclusive-but-moderately-compelling-as-a-whole studies suggest that there’s another way that might be more effective.

There is a growing cottage industry devoted to figuring out what kinds of music make people more effective, more efficient workers. Certain genres — especially those without vocals — are frequently linked with “working.” But the actual scientific evidence concerning the links between music and productivity are varied and tend to be hyper-specialized.

Some studies indicate that music, or at least some sort of organized noise, can raise efficiency; one such study found that those performing repetitive office-like tasks were more efficient while listening to music than while working in silence. Other studies have gone more specific, focusing on specific genres like baroque classical music or even simple nature sounds, analyzing productivity’s correlation with how much the worker likes or dislikes the music (the results: if you want efficiency, don’t listen to music you particularly like or dislike), or whether the listener is an introvert or extrovert (introverts do better with silence, extroverts do better with music).

Muddling the science on this topic even further are the nearly equal number of studies indicating that music doesn’t, in fact, help you concentrate more efficiently. The amount of variables in any of these correlational studies are enough to crush any confident conclusion.

Despite their inconclusiveness, these studies have dovetailed with modern music streaming services in some interesting ways. For one thing, streaming services give listeners access to music they’d not normally buy — which, let’s be real, includes popular “productivity” music like classical and jazz. But because the libraries are so vast, they necessitates some sort of curation to surface music best-suited to getting work done.

Thus, Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music, and others all boast these so-called “productivity playlists,” curated selections of songs designed to help you work — and they’re often very popular. According to Dayle Dempsey at Pandora, ‘Classical for Studying’ has been their top classical station since August 2013.

Most services offer a wide variety of productivity playlists. Google Play has classical, jazz, and instrumental pop stations, but also trip-hop, dubstep, instrumental trap, and quite a bit of metal. Tidal’s playlists under the “Focus” category include “Autumn Piano,” “Blips and Blops,” and “Post-Rock Essentials” along with more expected playlists like instrumental jazz and classical. Spotify’s productivity playlists also fall under a category titled “Focus,” and include instrumental hip-hop, indie folk, a fair amount of low-key electronic music, and even white noise.

The major attribute that seems to signal “focus music” to Spotify is a lack of vocals, as there is a bit of science suggesting that intelligible lyrics can have a negative effect on productivity, and quite a bit of anecdotal evidence suggesting it’s annoying. Furthering this point, Gregory Ciotti, writing for HelpScout, writes:

Research from Applied Acoustics shows that “intelligible” chatter — talking that can be clearly heard and understood — is what makes for a distracting environment. Shifting focus to figure out what someone else is saying is the reason why speech is often considered the most troublesome element of a noisy office; in one study, 48% of participants listed intelligible talking as the sound which distracted them the most.

Consistency between songs is another key attribute. You want a long enough playlist — several hours long at least — with similar-sounding music. Not necessarily mellow music, but music without major shifts in tone or beats-per-minute or genre. Big peaks and valleys can shock a listener out of the productivity zone, which you don’t want.

Given the utilitarian and somewhat robotic nature of productivity playlists, you might think they’re created by algorithms. Not so much. “All the stations are hand-curated,” says Jessica Suarez, who leads a team of in-house playlists editors at Google Play Music. In fact, her team crafts them based mostly on anecdotal information, personal preferences, and determined browsing of comments on the internet. “I’m a big Lifehacker reader, so I go through a bunch of the comments from people about what they like to listen to at work,” Suarez explains. “I also go through Reddit threads on what coders like to listen to at work. That informs a bunch of the stations.”

Even though the playlists are made by humans, Spotify, Tidal, and Google obviously have tons of data on what people are listening to: how much of a song they play, how often something is skipped, when volume changes, when a song is repeated or added to a user’s playlist, all kinds of stuff. “If people are skipping songs you know you’re taking them out of the moment, so we tend to weigh that more heavily and be more aggressive with how we edit [the productivity] stations,” Suarez elaborates.

Pandora — the media company that developed the Music Genome Project—takes a blended approach, drawing multiple data points from humans and machines. What a listener actually ends up hearing on Pandora is the result of a complex interplay between the two. Rhodes Kelley — a product manager at Pandora who works on their radio algorithm — elaborates: “There are more than 60 ‘strategies’ that can fire in tandem every time we need to find a song to play. A human curated strategy can nominate a song at the same time as a personalized data strategy nominates it alongside a musicological content based one. The layers of strategies picking tracks simultaneously allow the algorithm to blend all of our strengths together.”

Ultimately, the divide between algorithms and human curation comes down to how one perceives what music is. Music is different than other forms of data — for example your weather or fitness apps — in that it elicits emotional and cultural responses. For the techno-utopian inclined, the solution is simply to build smarter algorithms to parse the data — thus providing the best possible outputs for the user; but for those who see musical data as an incontrovertible cultural/emotional artifact, algorithms can never match the intentionality of human curation. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle.",https://medium.com/the-sound-of-innovation/the-secret-sauce-behind-your-productivity-playlist-b5dc2e124d8b,ᴅᴀɴ ɴᴏsᴏᴡɪᴛᴢ,2016-07-07 16:34:07.741000+00:00,"Work,Music,Science,Productivity,Algorithms"
Routine Matters More Than Ritual,"The Shining. All rights © Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.

Good routines are portable. And good routines are pliable. By all means, sanctify your spaces. If you are able to craft a workspace that inspires you then enjoy that coveted place to begin the hard work. But let your ritual adorn your routine instead of dictating it.

If you work best with classical music while sitting at your west-facing desk with a paperweight-heavy Himalayan pink sea salt candle deionizing your air, it’s wonderful that you’ve discovered that and cultivated an inspired atmosphere for your creativity.

But if you absolutely cannot work without your lucky pen, your ergonomic desk chair, and your favorite notebook what happens when you go out of town? Or family obligations arise? Or work conflicts? What happens when your writing makes you so successful that you need to travel for speaking engagements and book tours? That’s the goal, isn’t it? So how do you maintain that routine in hotel rooms? On layovers? In different time zones with jet lag compromising every lobe of your wobbly brain?

Ritual is how you decorate your space. Routine is how you use your time. Wherever you are. While there is some overlap there, and ritual can be emotively beautiful, you can’t be beholden to it. If you are it has become superstition instead of the steady grind.

Find what works for you. And stick with each iteration, each experiment to really exhaust its possibilities before discarding it like a diet that didn’t immediately drop you to your desired weight. Give routines time to succeed. But remember that there are almost as many productivity programs and ideas as there are people. What skyrocketed someone with no writing experience to the top of the NYT Bestseller list might not work for you.

But I’m certain it is not the ritual that makes the writer but the routine. There is a subtle distinction that I appreciate after twenty years of being a “writer” who barely wrote a thing for those two decades.

Author Roger Zelazny made a bargain with himself to write two sentences six times every day. Even if he didn’t “catch fire”. I immediately dismissed that as impossible and pointless for me. Then I read about him. In addition to novellas, anthologies, novelettes, short stories, and series he wrote damn near a novel a year for more than three decades.

I doubt he relied on inspiration alone.

“ … the best way to achieve a goal is to focus less on the outcome and more on the process, and that that applies across all cultures,” — Melanie Rudd of the University of Houston.

Once during college, I literally stayed up until 5 something in the morning to write an invective against the Girl Scouts and specifically against the mandate of selling Girl Scout cookies for my Economics department newsletter.

Inspiration struck and for once I saw it through to completion. Even though I was exhausted and wanted to go to sleep. Lightning had electrified the apartment and the computer was on fire with a clear and cohesive narrative. Our editor/dean of undergraduates really liked it. Other student contributors started to write in a similarly casual first-person narrative that showcased their working knowledge of the economics concepts we were learning. I was pleased.

Ten years later I brought my Ipad with me when my family took an unexpected but beautiful trip back to Germany where we had lived until I was little. On the flight over I randomly wrote an appraisal of The Weeknd’s video for Earned It. Even though no one was paying me for my writing at that time I reminded myself that paid writers would likely be utilizing a transatlantic flight to get writing done. A family vacation was no excuse to not write. And it should also be an inspiration to write about the adventure itself. Incidentally, my Ipad swallowed that article and spit it into an abyss somewhere I can’t find. But I remember being pleased that my review of his video (and the song itself) reflected the ethereal and sensual nonchalance of the aesthetic and something or other about his diaphanous voice.

Routine is how you use your time. Ritual is how you decorate your space.

If I only wrote within my ritual, these moments of inspiration would have faded out like music when you walk away from a house party. Notes would never become songs if I only wrote within inspired moments or ritualized spaces.

You don’t have to do anything. But I have found that consistency is key. All the writers who write about writing describe this too — cultivating your zone takes consistency more than inspiration.

Inspiration is fleeting, unsustainable and, most importantly, unpredictable. You can’t rely on it since you never know when it will strike or how long it will last.

When I was 13 I randomly won a hundred dollars from the local radio station. A hundred whole dollars! I bought a stereo system with TWO tape decks so I could record, aaand … a CD player. Please excuse me for bragging but if you were a middle-schooler in the early 90s you know what a colossal lifestyle change that was.

That was a stroke of random luck. I did not grow up to rely on radio station contests for income.

Celebrate inspiration when it graces you with its presence. But treat it like luck. And never depend on it.

Medical doctor and bestselling novelist Khaled Hosseini talked about how his runaway hit The Kiterunner eventually started writing itself during his 4–6 am writing routine. Then he went to work and doctor-ed every day.

His routine became his zone.

I often go back to quotes from best-selling authors Gillian Flynn and Stephen King when I hit a wall.

Gillian Flynn said, “I could not have written a novel if I hadn’t been a journalist first, because it taught me that there’s no muse that’s going to come down and bestow upon you the mood to write. You just have to do it. I’m definitely not precious.”

And Stephen King, who’s written more words than most of us have ever spoken in our entire lives famously said, “Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work.”

This is not to say that flow is constant. It’s not. But what makes writers write is consistency. There is no substitute for your hands on the keyboard. Maybe you’re fortunate enough to craft an inspired space that stimulates ideas and connects neural pathways but if you depend on it, if your hands can’t find the keyboard without your rituals, your servant has become your master.

Don’t get so superstitious about how you create that you stop actually creating.",https://medium.com/the-ascent/routine-matters-more-than-ritual-848ee0caf5ee,Heather M. Edwards,2019-06-23 23:18:12.362000+00:00,"Self Improvement,Personal Development,Writing,Productivity,Creativity"
Data Science for Startups: R -> Python,"Source: Yuri_B at pixabay.com

One of the pieces of feedback I received for my blog series Data Science for Startups was that Python would be a better choice for data scientists joining a startup. This makes a lot of sense if Python is already your go to language for performing data science tasks. In my case, I have much more experience in R and wanted to provide an introduction to working with startups using a language that I’ve previously used to solve problems.

Now that I’ve completed the series and turned it into a book, I want to start digging into Python as a scripting language for data science. For now I still prefer Java for productizing models, using DataFlow, but that preference may change as I become more familiar with the language. I’d like to port some of my previous articles to Python from R, to provide an introduction for a broader audience. Here’s my main motivation for exploring Python:

Startup Tooling: Many startups are already using Python for production, or portions of their data pipelines. It makes sense to also use Python for performing analysis tasks.

PySpark: R and Java don’t provide a good transition to authoring Spark tasks interactively. You can use Java for Spark, but it’s not a good fit for exploratory work, and the transition from Python to PySpark seems to be the most approachable way to learn Spark.

I previously used R to author custom loss functions, and debugging errors was problematic.

I previously used R to author custom loss functions, and debugging errors was problematic. Python Libraries: In addition to the deep learning libraries offered for Python, there’s a number of other useful tools including Flask and Bokeh. There’s notebook environments that can scale including Google’s Colaboratory and AWS SageMaker.

There’s two additional topics that I’d like to cover that I did not provide content for in the initial series:

Virtualization: Once you start running large jobs, you need a better environment for scaling up to work with large data sets. I used Google’s DataFlow in the initial series, but want to present tools that are useful for scaling up analysis when working interactively.

Once you start running large jobs, you need a better environment for scaling up to work with large data sets. I used Google’s DataFlow in the initial series, but want to present tools that are useful for scaling up analysis when working interactively. Spark: I’d like to explore more of the Spark ecosystem, including tools such as the recently announced MLflow. Spark provides a nice environment for working with large scale data, and more easily moving from exploration to production tasks.

To start, I plan on revisiting my previous posts that were R heavy, and provide a port of these posts to Python. Here are the topics in my original series that need to be translated to Python:

Many of these sections can be translated directly, but posts such as Business Intelligence will require using different libraries, such as Bokeh instead of Shiny. I won’t update the sections on DataFlow, since those are authored in Java. However, it is possible to write DataFlow tasks using Python. Instead of porting Java to Python, I’ll explore new tools for productizing work such as Spark and SageMaker.

The goal of this post is to motivate my transition to Python and to provide an introduction to getting up and running with a Jupyter notebook. Given my new focus on virtualization, I also wanted to show how to work with a remote machine on AWS. The remainder of this post discusses how to spin up an EC2 instance on AWS, set up Jupyter notebooks for remote connections, and query data from BigQuery in Python.

Setting up Jupyter

There’s a number of great IDEs available for Python, such as PyCharm. However, I’m going to be focusing on Jupyter, since it’s a notebook environment and many of the tools that are used for scalable data science are based on notebooks, such as DataBricks for Spark, Colaboratory, and SageMaker. It may be useful to start with an IDE when learning the basics of the language, but it’s good to become familiar with notebook environments given the popularity of this type of environment for large-scale tools.

One of the common tasks discussed when getting started with Python is setting up a virtual environment in order to install Python and any necessary libraries, using tools such as virtualenv. It’s a good practice to set up a virtual environment when using Python, because there may be conflicts between libraries, you may need to run multiple versions of Python, or you may want to create a fresh install to start over. Docker is another option, but is much more heavyweight that virtualenv. For this post, I’ll discuss launching an EC2 instance on AWS for setting up a Python 3 environment. This is also much more heavyweight than using virtualenv, but it provides the ability to scale up the size of the machine if necessary when working with larger data sets. It’s also a good opportunity to become more familiar with AWS and getting started with virtualizing data science tasks.

Security is another important consideration when setting up a notebook environment, since you don’t want your workspace to be open to the world. The most secure way of connecting to a Jupyter notebook when using AWS is to set up an SSH tunnel with port forwarding, which ensures that clients can only connect to the notebook if they have the required private key. Another option is to open up the notebook to the open web, but restrict which machines can connect to the EC2 instance. I’ll present the later approach in this post, since it requires fewer steps, but strongly recommend the former approach for any real task.

Launching an EC2 Instance

This post assumes that you’ve already created an AWS account. AWS provides a number of free-tier options that you can use to become familiar with the platform. EC2 is a service that you can use to spin up and connect to virtual machines. We’ll spin up an EC2 instance and use it to host Jupyter notebooks. Documentation on using EC2 is available here.

Launching an EC2 instance on AWS

Perform the following steps from the EC2 Dashboard to launch a machine:

1. Click “Launch Instance”

2. Select “Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0”

3. Select “t2.micro”, which is free tier eligible

4. Click “Review and Launch”

5. Click “Launch” and then select a key for connecting via SSH

6. Click “Launch Instances” and then “View Instances”

We’ll also need to edit the machine’s configuration in order to allow inbound Jupyter connections on port 8888. By default, an EC2 instance only allows inbound connections on port 22 using a private key for authentication. Documentation on configuring security groups is available here.

Setting up an exception for port 8888 for Jupyter.

We’ll allow inbound connects to the EC2 instance on port 8888 for only the host machine. Perform the following steps from the EC2 dashboard:

1. Select your EC2 instance

2. Under “Description”, select the security (e.g. launch-wizard-1)

3. Click “Actions” -> “Edit Inbound Rules”

4. Add a new Rule: change the port to 8888, under source, select “My IP”

5. Click “Save”

After performing these steps, you now have an EC2 instance up an running, with an open port available for connecting to Jupyter. In order to connect to your instance, you’ll need a tool such as Putty. Instructions for Windows users are available here. Another option is to using Java to connect directly to your instance. However, I haven’t used this before, and it’s deprecated in Chrome.

Installing Jupyter

Once you’re able to connect to your instance, you’ll need to set up Python 3 and Jupyter. The instance should already have Python 2.7 installed, but we want to use a newer version. Run the following commands to install Python 3, pip, and Jupyter:

sudo yum install -y python36

python36 --version

curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

sudo python36 get-pip.py

pip3 --version

pip3 install --user jupyter

The Amazon linux distro is based on RedHat, so yum is used to install software. Pip is Python’s package manager, which we’ll use to install libraries in a later step. I’ve also included statements to check the install versions.

Private IP and Public IP details for my test instance.

By default, Jupyter only accepts connections from the local machine. This can be changed by using the --ip command. For this to work on an EC2 instance, you’ll need to use the private IP of the machine. This is 172.31.60.173 in the figure above. You can enable remote connections and launch Jupyter using the following command:

jupyter notebook --ip Your_AWS_Prive_IP

When Jupyter launches, it mentions a specific URL to copy into your browser in order to run notebooks. Since we configured Jupyter to use the Private IP, this is what will be printed out when launching Jupyter. To connect to the machine, you’ll need to copy the link, but also modify the IP from the private IP to the public IP, which is 18.206.244.128 in the above figure.



The Jupyter Notebook is running at:

http://Your_AWS_Private_IP:8888/?token=dd921a6c4ebc3a3bb90fcd8ac44394692a80685705da30e3 # output from running the commandThe Jupyter Notebook is running at:

http://Your_AWS_Public_IP:8888/?token=dd921a6c4ebc3a3bb90fcd8ac44394692a80685705da30e3 # switch the internal IP to external to run in a browser

If everything was successful, you should now see Jupyter in your browser.

The Jupyter landing page on my EC2 instance.

You now have a notebook running for authoring interactive python 3 scripts!

Connecting to BigQuery

Now that we have a Jupyter notebook up and running, the first step I wanted to explore before digging into Business Intelligence and EDA was figuring out how to pull data from BigQuery to a Pandas DataFrame for analysis. While Google does provide a library for working with GCP in Python (google-cloud-storage), we don’t need to use it for this specific use case. The pandas-gbq library makes it easy to accomplish the task of pulling result sets locally for analysis. To set up this library, as well as matplotlib for plotting, run the following commands in the terminal:

pip3 install --user pandas-gbq

pip3 install --user matplotlib

We can switch back to the Jupyter environment and start working with BigQuery public data sets. The first line in the snippet below loads the pandas library, which is installed as a dependency when installing pandas-gbq. The second line identifies the product id to use when running queries. The third command runs a query that pulls a data sample from the Natality data set, and assigns the result set to a pandas DataFrame. The final step displays information about the data types in the df object. When you first run this script, the notebook will prompt you for a key as part of authenticating with Google. Click on the provided link and copy the key to proceed.

import pandas as pd projectid = ""your_project_id"" df = pd.read_gbq(""""""SELECT *

FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality` limit 100"""""",

projectid, dialect = ""standard"") df.info()

For R users, info() in Python is similar to str(), and describe() is similar to summary(). If you want to get a feel for the shape of the data set, you can use some of the built-in plotting functions for DataFrame objects, which generate plots using matplotlib. The snippet below shows how to select two columns from the DataFrame, and plot histograms for these attributes:

df[['weight_pounds', 'mother_age']].hist()

This generates the following matplotlib visualization:

Histograms of attributes in the Natality data set.

We now have an environment set up where we can pull data from BigQuery into pandas DataFrames for analysis. The workbook is available on Github here and a rendered version is available here. I’ve already been using Jupyter notebooks for some of my analysis, so having a Python connection set up with BigQuery in this environment is a good first step to porting my R analysis to Python. The next step is learning how to perform exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling using Python libraries.

Conclusion

As a next step in my series on Data Science for Startups, I’m exploring the use of Python instead of R for scripting tasks. Python provides many great libraries that motivate this port, including deep learning, a more gentle introduction to Spark, and scalable notebook environments. This post showed how to set up an EC2 instance and remotely work with Jupyter notebooks. It also showed how to pull data from BigQuery.

The Manchurian Plague,"As of the time of this writing, a new and more contagious strain of the Coronavirus has been reported in the United Kingdom. Initial findings state that it spreads 70% faster than the original one that we are all too familiar with. It's horrible news going into the start of 2021 and only further underlines the need for masks and other personal protective equipment.

For those of you who refuse to believe the evidence of its protection, I offer a page from medical history: the Manchurian Plague of 1910. It was an event widely credited for making the use of personal protective equipment a standard in efforts to stop the spread of disease.

How did it start?

A Tarbagan marmot, by Stephane Magnenat, CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons

Most experts believe that the plague started from an infected Tarbagan marmot. These rodents were usually hunted because locals turned their fur into clothes for trade.

The disease's spread was further intensified when marmot hunters started taking more and more fur for the harsh winter months. International traders from Japan and Russia created even more demand for the fur, spiking up the value for marmot hides. And while most local hunters disposed of diseased marmots for food, they did not do the same for its hides — given that they were compensated well for it.

Slowly but surely, locals started experiencing headaches, fevers, coughs, and shortness of breath. And since the period lacked the medical advancements we have today, the disease's mortality rate was incredibly high.

Similar to our current pandemic, all this was magnified when people started traveling to see their families for the Chinese New Year. The disease followed the railway systems locals were using to get home. It spread across Beijing, Wuhan, and was even noted to be in some parts of Shanghai, almost 2,000 miles from the first reported case.

In Manzhouli, an Inner Mongolian town, piles of corpses were left on the streets. The few hospitals that were in the area couldn’t accommodate the sick, so railway freight cars were used as quarantine wards.

How did authorities handle it?

Mass cremation workers for Manchurian plague victims (1911), by Dr. Richard Pearson Strong, CC BY-SA 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons.

Dr. Wu Lien-teh, a Cambridge schooled physician, led the Chinese medical efforts against the deadly plague. His main approach, which was innovative for the time, was an emphasis on the wearing of cloth face masks and other personal protective equipment.

Wu also implemented harsh forms of quarantine, isolation, and travel restrictions. He would go as far as burning down houses with a known high infection rate.

With his efforts, the disease was at least contained to China’s Manchurian region, as opposed to being a nationwide health crisis. But what Wu is truly significant for was his ability to call for a multinational medical response against the plague. He held an international Plague Conference in Mukden in April 1911, and it was the first of its kind. The conference perhaps laid the foundation for the World Health Organization we have today.

However, while there was an international team of doctors, epidemiologists, and nurses handling the situation, not everybody agreed with Wu’s approach of using masks and personal protective equipment.

A French doctor named Gerald Mesny catered to those in quarantine but refused to wear a mask. After just a few days from starting his medical mission, Dr. Mesny died from being infected by one of his patients. He is among the 60,000 lives the plague took from this world.

Final Thoughts

We’ve come a long way from crude forms of personal protective equipment and experimental vaccines. Although much smaller in scale, the Manchurian plague parallels the hardships and medical responses of this year’s pandemic.

Against Outsourcing the Mind to a Soul,"image: tw

Brains are not just for eating

Until 9/11 I thought that the days were over when people could be immolated for having the wrong ideas about the soul. People have long been controlled by a fear that their immortal essence could suffer for eternity if they did not obey certain spiritual authorities.

“One of these mornings, the chain is gonna break.” — Aretha Franklin, Chain of Fools

Brains, Not Chains

While those chains have now crumbled for a lot of us, belief in a soul is still pretty common. It might be less so if more of us were aware of its stunning inconsistency with everyday reality: particularly the fact that we have brains.

There is overwhelming evidence that brains are what make our bodies into people; people who speak, think, adapt, and cope with life on the planet. Brains gather and integrate sensory information derived from energy fluctuations in the environment. The more precisely we can measure brain activity the more detailed we find to be their correlations with human conscious experiences.

And it’s not just humans. When we look at nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom, we see that brains operate bodies to enable their survival as well.

Nevertheless, the ineffable, private nature of human consciousness is often part of an argument that something — call it a soul — that is not physical causes consciousness. If that’s true, then why does the brain seem so obviously involved?

Can’t You Hear Me Knocking?

To answer this question many have used the analogy of the brain being like a radio receiver. As one fairly typical source puts it:

The brain does not produce consciousness, but acts as a kind of receiver which “picks up” the fundamental consciousness that is all around us, and “transmits” it into our own being.

Some proponents think deeply enough to realize this comes with an issue. It’s whether a soul is somehow an individual or else is a sort of world soul. Maybe, they say, the world soul has knots in it that correspond to individual people. Or, assuming panpsychism, also knots for individual monkeys, mice, molds, and even molecules. If it’s all just knots, which are presumably temporary, then maybe we are at least off the hook for eternal damnation. I certainly hope so.

By the modern account of soul-ism, all those messy neuronal networks roiling away in brains only appear to be responding to the outside world. Instead, some outside spirit runs the show. This is a dualistic position, subject to … more issues. For starters, what is left for the brain to do? If it has no purpose, why does it expend more energy than the leg muscles of a marathon runner?

Many of you are aware that there is massive and detailed evidence that life here, including animals with brains, evolved by the selection of genetic changes that contributed to survival and reproduction. Consistent with that view, brains evolved as a way of reacting to the physical world, the better for the organism to deal with it. Why then would the brain also function as a receiver of information from sources external to the physical world? That’s like having a bicycle that’s also a TV, but where the same parts serve both functions. A dual-function brain seems at least awkward and possibly self-contradictory.

We can dig a bit deeper. Consider what, given the soul, is the purpose of the brain and the organism in which it resides? Why would such a puny, space- and time-limited thing as a brain or an organism need to exist when the important, eternal stuff of consciousness is really elsewhere?

We know that our physical person lives in this world. Sane people know that to survive we have to perceive this world, think about it, respond to it, etc. But if all our consciousness — including what happens when we drive the car, eat the food, go to the work, hide from the boss — if all that we experience comes from that soul, how and why does the soul know exactly what is happening in the mundane world? The soul could know this if it was part of that mundane world, and thus subject to the world’s laws, but then the soul could not be transcendent, let alone eternal.

The Watcher-Watcher

So that can’t be what’s happening. The alternative would be something like a perfect watcher. And only Dr. Seuss could contrive anything quite so — well, contrived. The soul, perched on a lookout in some other dimension, uses an inter-dimensional portal to watch our body moving about in our mundane world. Instant by every instant the soul decides and deduces everything that needs to happen in our consciousness.

For example, based on a previous thought (that it already sent to us) about wanting to look at something, the soul pokes our brain, making it in turn move our eyeballs. After the first few hundredths of a degree of movement, the soul looks through the portal at our physical environment, deduces what our visual field should now look like, and sends to our brain that new picture, so that we consciously see it. And repeats this cycle of controlling every tiny mental change for billions of instants the rest of our life and then on to the subsequent incarnations. All that electrochemical activity in the retina and up the neuro-visual circuits, all the spinal motor nerve activity — all that has no purpose at all. Seems like a waste.

So, why would something as cumbersome as a perfect watcher ever happen in any universe? Why use a brain at all? The soul should just tell the meat puppet what it perceives and what to do.

So the soul gets rid of the need for a brain, really. But what about the body, and, for that matter, the whole world it lives in? Maybe that is superfluous, too.

Why would we have a remote controller pulling our strings and dictating our reality from a realm outside of our realm, the one where we actually have to live? If such a controller did exist, it’s more like a god than an individual agent. After all, it has perfect control over our experience of “reality.” So a godlike soul does not need a body. In fact, it doesn’t need any reality other than its own. Maybe it’s just playing a virtual reality game in which we, the bodies with brains, are the pieces on the board?

It’s a Team Player, too

Now we have to ask, why does the game being played by my soul seem consistent with the game played by your soul, in the sense that they seem to be in one world, with consistent laws of physics, configurations of biology, timelines, and so forth? Like, who’s coordinating the souls to create this one-world illusion? How many levels of coordinators would there be? Here, I admit, is where a world soul would have an easier time of it, keeping things consistent.

Going back to real life for a moment: there’s a strong case that each of us (using our brains) models and lives in a kind of personal virtual reality, called an Ego Tunnel by philosopher Thomas Metzinger. What makes this work is that we are all doing our individual take on a base reality that contains all of us.

But if souls are actually in charge, doing the models and everything else, then uh-oh, there’s that coordination issue again. Souls that did not coordinate well, who had differences in their recipes for reality soufflé, would lead some of us to experiences that others would never see. People who believe in and experience unusual (“supernatural”) things should thus find the concept of souls sensible, and I think that they often do.

Just Give Brains a Chance

The brain receiver idea pops up often, as if it solves some conceptual problem of connecting the physical world with consciousness, which seems askew from the physical. But the concept has problems, as I hope I have expressed. It seems so much more sensibly self-consistent that consciousness is just a refined way of using nervous tissue to do a better job of adapting to the physical, measurable, and shared non-supernatural world that we perceive as our conscious reality.

We can be open to the possibility that all experience, even the weird stuff, comes from one universe, and that brains participate actively/creatively in all of it. For example, there are certainly transcendent experiences. Perhaps these happen when higher parts of the brain/mind’s conscious model “get out of the way.” Something like this was proposed by Metzinger to describe the experience of “pure consciousness” — the “void” or sometimes, “clear light”— during deep meditation.

To summarize: one can argue that reducing the brain to a sort of side effect doesn’t make much sense. There are also arguments that the brain is involved in rarer conscious states (like near-death or out-of-body experiences) that some think to require a soul instead. Those are too involved to address here. Maybe some readers will remind us of them.",https://medium.com/the-philosophers-stone/against-outsourcing-the-mind-to-a-soul-22ce1e1243c8,Ted Wade,2020-10-19 01:10:43.460000+00:00,"Philosophy,Brain,Consciousness,Psychology,Science"
How to Customize QuickSight Dashboards for User Specific Data,"We have been getting a lot of queries on how to customize a single QuickSight dashboard for user specific data. We can accomplish this by filtering the dashboard data with login username using AWS QuickSight’s Row-Level Security. To further explain this use-case, let’s consider the sales department in a company. Every day your team of sales agents contacts a list of potential customers. Now you need a single dashboard that is accessed by all the agents but only displays the list of prospects he or she is assigned to.

Note: This is completely different from filter/controls on QuickSight dashboards. If you have filters/controls/parameters set up with dynamic values being picked up from the dataset, then even that data is filtered with Row-Level security, as the underlying dataset itself is filtered with the login username.

Let’s get on with the show! I have created a hypothetical data set. This dataset has a column named assigned-agent which shall be used for filtering.

Using this dataset, I have created a dashboard that looks like so.

This dashboard is shared with two other IAM users (sales agents).

As we haven’t set up any rules both of them can access whole data.

As you can see ziva could also access whole data and we don’t want that!

Our requirement is something like this:

Creating Data Set Rules for Row-Level Security:

Create a file or a query that contains the data set rules (permissions).

It doesn’t matter what order the fields are in. However, all the fields are case-sensitive. They must exactly match the field names and values.

The structure should look similar to one of the following. You must have at least one field that identifies either users or groups. You can include both, but only one is required, and only one is used at a time. If you are specifying groups, use only Amazon QuickSight groups or Microsoft AD groups.

The following example shows a table with user names.

For SQL:

/* for users*/

select User as UserName, Agent as agent_assigned from permissions_table;

Or if you prefer to use a .csv file:

UserName,agent_assigned

""nick"",""Nick Howe""

""ziva"",""Ziva Medalle""

""manager"",""Nick Howe,Ziva Medalle""

Here agent_assigned is a column in the dataset, and UserName is the same as QuickSight login name.

What we are essentially doing is mapping UserName with the agent_assigned column. Let’s suppose ziva has logged in, only those records with condition agent_assigned = Ziva Medalle are picked up. Same is the case with nick.

But in the case of the manager, we want him to be a superuser, so we added all the agent names ( agent_assigned column values).

Note: If you are using an Athena or an RDS or a Redshift or an S3 CSV file-based dataset, just make sure the output format/structure of those sources matches the above-mentioned formats.

Create Permissions Data Set:

Create a QuickSight dataset with the above data set rules. Go to Manage data, choose New data set, choose source and create accordingly. As mine is a CSV, I have just uploaded it. To make sure that you can easily find it, give it a meaningful name, for example in my case Permissions-prospects-list.

After finishing, Refresh the page as it might not appear in the data sources list while applying it to the dataset.

Creating Row-Level Security:

Choose Permissions, From the list choose the permissions dataset that you have created earlier.

Choose Apply data set.

Once you have applied, you should be seeing the dataset has a new lock symbol on it saying restricted.

That’s it. Now the data is filtered/secured based on username.

Manager’s Account:

Ziva’s Account:

Nick’s Account:

You could also add Users to Groups and have permissions set at the group level. More information here.

I hope it was helpful, any queries drop them in the comments section.

The Man Who Cut Off His Own Hand to Avoid Certain Death,"The Man Who Cut Off His Own Hand to Avoid Certain Death

Aron Ralston

A selfie taken by Aron Ralston when he was stuck with his hand between the canyon and boulder and a picture of the bolder after the incident (Source: The Guardian)

Life can bring us major challenges that will test not only our character but our will to fight against the odds. In Aron Ralston’s case, life brought the challenge of a lifetime, which most people don’t encounter and even those who do will most likely fail. In 2003, Ralston had to make a drastic decision, it was either cutting off his hand or dying. As always, things are not as simple as they sound, this is why we need to dig deeper into what actually happened.

Just another hike outdoors

Aron Ralston is a mechanical engineer and since a young age, he loved to spend his free time outdoors. He kept this hobby throughout his life, escaping his job and going out in the wilderness, exploring the vast nature that America has to offer. In 2003, he decided to take a hike in the Bluejohn Canyon (Wayne County, Utah). He was quite good at hiking, but no matter how good you are, the terrain can always play against your plan.

As he was hiking the canyon, a big boulder fell in the crater that Ralston found himself in, locking his hand between the canyon and the boulder. The boulder weighed at least a couple of tonnes, therefore there was no way to move it. Although Ralston tried to use his equipment to move the boulder, he had no luck.

Surrounded by miles of unhabited wilderness, his chances of being helped by someone were extremely slim. After the first day passed whilst he was stuck, friends and family were worried that he didn’t come back from his hike. He never told anyone the path he was going to take. He had a cellphone, but he had no signal whatsoever down in the narrow crater.

He tried the small swiss knife he had to break the boulder enough to free his hand, but it was to no good use. Due to his hand being stuck, he was in a very uncomfortable position that didn't allow him to sit down, which meant that he could not get much rest. As the fourth day passed of being stuck, he had lost all hope. He knew that no one was coming and with his food and water supplies depleted, death seemed certain.

A drastic decision

In a mind over matter thought, he knew deep down that the only way that he could survive was to cut his hand. Besides being a very despicable idea, it was either that or death. The problem was that Ralston only had his swiss knife on him, which was not the sharpest or the best tool to “surgically” remove a hand. You can only imagine how mentally difficult it is to harm yourself, let alone cut your own hand.

Between a Rock and a Hard Place by Aron Ralston

With the belt he had on him as well as some other ropes, he tied all of them around his arm to stop the bleeding whilst cutting the hand. So he started cutting as quickly as possible in order to lose the least amount of blood possible. A good description of this gruesome experience is offered in Ralston’s autobiography, Between a Rock and a Hard Place.

After Ralston managed to cut his hand off, he rushed out of the canyon, and to his luck, he ran into some tourists that helped him. It is so difficult to imagine the mental position you not only have to be placed by a certain event but also the mental position in which you need to put yourself in to be able to cut off your own hand, or any limb for that matter.

Would you be able to make such a drastic decision if your life depended on it?",https://medium.com/history-of-yesterday/the-man-who-cut-off-his-own-hand-to-avoid-certain-death-3f7527192873,Andrei Tapalaga,2020-12-28 13:30:38.952000+00:00,"Life Lessons,Health,History,Mental Health,Psychology"
Use Rebellion to Combat FOMO,"FOMO: the Fear of Missing Out.

Who has it? Come on. Raise your hand. I’m just going to assume y’all are raising the roof, because I know that you’ve felt it before.

That feeling when it seems like everyone you know is doing a thing, and you aren’t. The energy is infectious, and you’ve been bitten by the bug, but whatever that thing is, it doesn’t fit for you.

Maybe it’s NaNoWriMo. Every November, everyone you know is out there writing a whole damn book in 30 days, and meanwhile, you don’t write fiction. You’re a blogger.

Maybe it’s the Blog-Your-Own-Book Challenge. Your writing friends are busy planning their BYOB project, and you’re a fiction writer who does’t really want to write a bunch of blog posts.

Maybe it’s — any situation where everyone else is on the boat and you wish you were, too, even though you don’t really want to be.

I have a proposition for you.

Grab onto the tail of that energy.

It’s the energy of the thing that matters the most. The idea that a conglomeration of people are all working toward the same goal at the same time.

Think about this: It doesn’t really matter if your goal is different.

You can take that tiger by the tail. Use the energy and enthusiasm to do your own work, your own way.

Let’s take NaNoWriMo. Maybe, instead of trying to write a 50,000 word novel in thirty days, you make some other big, hairy writing goal. Finish editing that book you’ve already written. Write some crazy number of blog posts — 50 or even 100 maybe? Something that will push you.

Because it’s pushing yourself to do more than you thought you could that’s the whole point. You can tap into the excitement surrounding NaNoWriMo and use that energy to do whatever you want to do.

Whoo, boy. Rebellion is intoxicating.

How to tap into BYOB if you’re not a blogger.

The Blog-Your-Own-Book Challenge is supposed to be a call to write 31 blog posts in August, all on the same topic, and turn them into a book you can sell to create an income stream or use as a lead magnet.

But what if you’re a fiction writer and you don’t really want to try to blog a novel? What if you want to be traditionally published and don’t actually want to publish your book via a blog before you try to sell it? What if you have some other project that needs your attention in August?

Be a rebel. Really. Go on and try it.

Tap into the energy that’s created when a bunch of people are all excited about the same thing at the same time. And then use that energy to do whatever you want to do.

Need some ideas? Here are a bunch:

If you’re a fiction writer, create a series of flash fiction stories that are set in the world of your novel. They’ll make a great lead magnet.

Use BYOB to explore a topic you’ve been interested in, but you haven’t actually written about before.

Learn a new skill in August and blog about the process. Teach as you go.

Edit your last completed first draft in August. Break it up into 31 parts and finish one a day.

Sign up for Teachable and use August to create your first (or next) online course.

If you want to try to traditionally publish your book, choose a topic that’s tangental to blog about during BYOB, you’ll end up with a minimum viable product or a lead magnet. Plus your posts will attract the audience you want for your book when you do write it.

The possibilities are nearly endless. Rebellion is encouraged around here.",https://medium.com/the-write-brain/use-rebellion-to-combat-fomo-351f491e3d,Shaunta Grimes,2020-07-25 16:54:36.895000+00:00,"Creativity,Byob,Blogging,Productivity,Writing"
Conversations With Alexa,"We were engaged in a spirited debate about whether to order dishes or combo meals from our local Chinese Food restaurant when Alexa chimed in: “Maybe you should get one platter and then two orders of rice to split.”

“Is that enough food for both of us?” I asked.

“According to Lotus Flower’s menu choices, which indicate that the combos are family style and the rice comes in quarts, it is,” said Alexa.

“But we’re really hungry,” my wife pleaded with Alexa.

‘Okay, okay,” said Alexa, “Then I suggest two kids dinners and three..”

“Wait.” I interrupted, “Aren’t kids dinners really small?”

“No,” Alexa answered without losing a step, “They’re just 3 ounces smaller. But you should also get three orders of rice,” said Alexa, sounding a bit exasperated.

“Hey, that all sounds pretty good. We want Kung Pao chicken and Chow Mein kids meals,” said my wife.

“Ordering,” said Alexa.

Full disclosure: This didn’t happen and is not possible with current Alexa, but Natural Turn Taking (not the most elegant name), which Amazon revealed this week as part of the near-future of its Alexa voice assistant (and a small part of a major fall product rollout), could make a three-way conversation like this more than possible.

Think about it this way: The fears you’ve had that, when talking in front of an Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices, that there’s always someone else in the room, possibly listening to you, is sort of coming true.

Or put another way, you’ll soon be giving Alexa the okay to do something it’s been doing for ages anyway, butting in.

The State of Alexa

If there is a race to make our voice assistants more human-like in their conversational abilities, Amazon is firmly in the middle. Alexa doesn’t possess the Turing Test challenging skill of Google’s Duplex, which, to be fair is highly-trained, narrowly focused add-on for Google Assistant that works in 48 of 50 states to help you make dinner and hair salon reservations. It can, however, answer follow-ups to initial questions without requiring the wake word.

It’s no better than Apple’s Siri or Google Assistant about not speaking unless spoken to. Alexa still responds to words similar to its watch word, from casual conversations in its vicinity, and commercials. Thank goodness I didn’t name either of my children “Alex.”

I grew up on a steady diet of Star Trek where the Enterprise AI “Computer” engaged in lengthy conversations with the Captain and Crew with one watch word and, after that, only the context provided by, usually, Captain Kirk. As a result, I know we’re still in the early days of real-world AI-based voice assistants.

A real conversation

Amazon’s Natural Turn Taking, though, is a pivotal step toward a more human-to-AI conversational future.

The ability to engage in a one way conversation is difficult enough for most AI voice assistants, a three way convo is a digital party in which the AI has to navigate who is speaking to whom (to Alexa or the other party), pauses as one speaker waits for a response, and the inevitable cross-talk, which is even more likely when you’re trying to make a decision.

In a blog post on the still-under-development technology, Amazon said Alexa uses a mixture of technologies to assess everything from acoustic to linguistic and even visual (I guess this will work on Echo Shows) cues to figure out when it’s time for Alexa to listen or interject.

As it’s currently being built, Alexa wouldn’t do any of that if someone doesn’t say, “Alexa, join my conversation,” which is about as natural as asking someone to pick up the fork to eat the food you just placed before them. Obviously, since Alexa is a disembodied observer in the conversation, it makes sense to formally invite her to engage.

While that invite might feel awkward, the rest of the conversation should not. Once Alexa is invited, there’s no need to use the watch word again until the end. Removing the need to say “Alexa” during these conversations greases the wheels of discussion nicely but doesn’t necessarily make it feel natural.

The concept of “barge-ins,” though, does help. Essentially, Amazon is now programming Alexa to identify when speakers break into an Alexa response to, perhaps, change the course of conversation or, maybe, identify which of a list of options they prefer. Amazon calls this “contextual barge-ins.” Instead of Alexa ignoring your interruption or, more likely, resetting to an earlier conversational state, this Alexa will know exactly when you interrupted and understand that you selected something or indicated heightened interest. This can help steer the three-way conversation to a more natural conclusion.

Brain training

In preparing for these future conversational abilities, the current Alexa is now teachable, learning from its mistakes and getting a firmer grasp on the difference between entities (a mode-based request like “set the volume to five”) and declarative statements (“the music is too loud”). Understanding how to handle the latter comment and that the response should be, “Okay, do you want me to lower the volume?” could also lead to future interactions where you saying, “The music is too loud,” automatically leads to Alexa lowering the volume to five.

Amazon is also working on improving Alexa’s tone of voice, letting her adapt her cadence and emphasis based on the context of the discussion. During the virtual launch event, Company reps played before and after versions of the same Alexa utterance but, to be honest, I think I still prefer the unadjusted one.

With some of this learning and adaptation in hand, the future Alexa could handle not just who is talking and when, but understand the context, nuance, and meaning of everything you say, and respond in kind during a spirited, likely task-based, discussion.

When the conversation is done, you’ll still have to tell Alexa to stop listening. Right now, Amazon has you saying, “Alexa, leave my conversation,” an especially awkward phrase that would probably hurt a human’s feelings. It’s a good reminder, though, that Alexa isn’t human, doesn’t have feelings, and is still a tool designed to help you get things done. It’s not a new party guest or best friend.

Now, pardon me while I go order some Chinese food.",https://medium.com/swlh/conversations-with-alexa-40ceedd4f282,Lance Ulanoff,2020-09-26 19:10:25.982000+00:00,"Amazon,Technology,Alexa,AI,Analysis"
Weight Loss ‘Before-and-After’ Images Are Not Inspiring — They’re Dangerous,"As a teenager, I pored over the ‘before-and-after’ images of weight loss in my mother’s magazines. They’d be splashed across the cover of every kind of periodical that was aimed at women, enticing them to part with hard-come-by cash with the promise of revealing The Magic Secret of how they, too, could transform. Some of these magazines were cheap, their flimsy covers soaked in coarse-coloured photographs and attention-grabbing headlines. Some were expensive: glossy, heavy paper-stock displaying pastel mastheads in refined fonts.

But they were all selling the same thing: some variation of the story about how a 300-pound woman had taken up a famous weight-loss plan and had ‘slimmed down’ to 110 pounds.

I would flip straight to the story and stare at those side-by-side photos, fascinated. In one picture, the woman would often look sheepish or embarrassed, the experience of being captured for posterity clearly mortifying. (She would have had no idea at the time it was taken that this would become her ‘before’ photograph. Had she known, she would have arched her body to hide some of its size, or pull at the hem of her top to cover more of what she carried.) If she were smiling, it would be a forced, pained look, as though someone had pressured her to pose and she’d been too polite, too lacking in power, to say no.

The ‘after’ shot was another story. The woman would appear ebullient, victorious, a broad smile lighting up her entire face. Her hairstyle would be more modern, more traditionally ‘feminine’; she would be wearing make-up and fashionable, figure-hugging clothes, possibly a tight dress with a belt cinching her in, emphasising her newly-small waist. Or she would be standing inside a pair of trousers that were now clearly too big, holding out the waistband with both hands and looking into the camera with a slightly raised brow, as if to say directly to us, “Can you believe these used to fit me?!” The articles would then expound on how all the woman had had to do was realise that the secret — The Magic Secret — was that you have to burn more calories than you intake. Ha! That’s all there is to it!

The articles would then expound on how all the woman had had to do was realise that the secret — The Magic Secret — was that you have to burn more calories than you intake. Ha! That’s all there is to it!

She wished she had known it twenty years earlier! She wished she had started calculating every ounce of what she had ingested and expended decades ago! She wished she had stepped on those scales every morning to measure how good or bad she’d been, and had always weighed her food, scooping back into the bag even a single excess gram. She wished she hadn’t been so naughty as to eat that extra slice of cake at the office birthday party. She wished she could have posed for more photographs with her children on holidays, at family get-togethers, at their birthday parties, instead of making herself busy when the camera was brought out. She was absent from the documentation of her own life because she hated the way her body looked.

At that age, I found the photographs inspiring, aspirational even. I have always lived in a larger body, though it has always fluctuated along that axis, sometimes parking at the small end for a while, sometimes the larger end, then back again. In my early teens, I felt my difference the most. I wanted to be effortlessly thin and attractive like the most popular girls at school, though I would have never admitted that to anyone. So I took comfort in these magazines, selling to me as they were the dream that I was an after waiting to happen.

I skimmed the copy in most of those stories, though. The self-hatred tasted too sour, too close to home. I didn’t want to know what this woman thought, or how she felt, and the magazine mostly took care of that inconvenience for me by offering no meaningful details about the woman’s life beyond her looks.

Was she a doctor? The article didn’t say. Had she overcome grief or trauma at a young age and was now a successful entrepreneur? We weren’t told. Had she raised thousands for charity and fundraised enough to open a school for local underprivileged children? There wasn’t enough space for that. And if you wanted to know such details, you were missing the point. There was plenty of room for an in-page advertisement about the famous weight loss plan the woman had followed in order to ‘shed those pounds’, but there wasn’t room to tell us about her daughter’s illness, or her partner’s alcoholism.

I read those articles in the 1990s. Though the facets that made the woman whole were explained in meagre details, back then it would have been considered uncouth to publish only the photographs; there had to be some text to accompany them, otherwise the whole thing would have seemed superficial, indecent, dehumanising.

A Century of the Same Old Message

But of course, weight loss before-and-afters did not start in the 1990s.

Magazines had been available to the general population — or at least, to those who could read, and were able to afford them —from the late 1600s. However, the first illustrated magazine — The Illustrated London News — wasn’t published until 1842. Weight loss tinctures and potions had been advertised for a number of years by then, but illustrations made the message of those advertisements much more generally accessible; even those who were not able to read would pick up on the message represented by an illustration of a large silhouette on the left side of the advert, and a significantly smaller one on the right.

The earliest before-and-after advertisement I found was from the March to August 1925 edition of Picture Play Magazine.

The ad is for ‘La-Mar Reducing Soap’ and features an illustration of three women standing on descending steps on a staircase, each progressively thinner. The headline reads, ‘Wash away fat and years of age with La-Mar Reducing Soap’. The soap claims to reduce the size of targeted areas without affecting other parts of the body, so that the user can get rid of the famously disgusting curses of ‘ungainly ankles’ or ‘unbecoming wrists’.

This type of before-and-after illustrated ad continued to appear in magazines throughout the 1920s. Cigarette brands had already been advertising their products as weight loss aids for years by the time the Kensitas cigarette brand bought ad-space for its own before-and-after illustrated adverts. In them, they extolled the virtues of smoking their cigarettes instead of eating between meals, because, ‘It’s better to be fit than fat’.

Then in the early 1930s, Lucky Strike launched its ‘Tempted to Over-Indulge’ campaign. They used full-colour, beautifully illustrated pieces to sell the idea that it was better to smoke than to ‘over-indulge’. Their ads featured either a man or woman, each straight-sized, participating in tennis, or diving, or horse riding, while behind them poses the larger silhouette of what we are to assume is the same person before they started smoking Lucky Strikes instead of snacking.

Not much has changed in the style of these adverts over the years. Photography started to overtake hand drawn illustrations in the middle of the twentieth century, but the template stayed much the same.

They’re still around today for one reason: they’re effective.

Of course, it’s not only print media that’s to blame for our preoccupation with transformation from fat to thin. Television has played its part, too.

One of the first major transformation reality shows was ABC’s Extreme Makeover (2002–2007). Contestants were separated from their family and friends and put through rigorous physical training, cosmetic surgery and wardrobe makeovers in order to make them meet more closely contemporaneous beauty standards.

Though much of the show focused on the details of the contestant’s cosmetic dental surgery, or rhinoplasty, or lip enhancement, the main pull was the ‘reveal’. Participants would be reintroduced to their families, who waited on the other side of a curtain with cameras already closed-up on their faces in anticipation of the moment their unrecognisable relative would emerge heavily made-up and styled, and now meeting all the requisite ideals of what attractive womanhood looks like.

FOX’s The Swan (2004) took the premise of Extreme Makeover and went even further — it turned the whole ordeal into a competition. Two women were pitted against one another every episode, each competing for the most significant ‘improvement’. At the end of the season, episode winners would then take part in a pageant wherein one of them would be crowned ‘The Swan’. So, not only were their faces and bodies nipped and tucked and pulled and stretched, the notion that this physical pain would release them from societal judgement wasn’t even true: they were still going to be judged, and could therefore still lose.

When the UK version of The Biggest Loser first aired in 2005, I remember wondering: who is this for?

In the same year, NBC’s The Biggest Loser debuted, and became undoubtedly the most famous weight-loss TV show ever. (Though it started in the US, it would go on to be franchised to over thirty-seven other territories around the world.) From its mocking title to the name-calling and ‘tough love’ tactics used by the show’s trainers each week, the whole programme seemed to be an exercise in shame and humiliation.

When the UK version first aired in 2005, I remember wondering: who is this for? Is it for thin people who enjoy watching fat people be condescended to and defamed in a legitimised context, allowing them to indulge in their own prejudice against people in larger bodies from the anonymity of their living rooms? Is it for fat people, so that they can watch avatars of themselves on screen and relive the vilification and opprobrium that they have likely experienced from anyone in the fitness industry when they have tried to enter that space, only to be harassed back out of it? I don’t remember what I concluded; likely it was: both.

The Internet: The Magazine that Never Ends

Fast-forward to 2020 and we have the internet, the magazine that never ends. The one you can never leave on the cluttered table in the dentist’s office, or avoid the ads of, as they flash in the sidebar of any article you might be reading. Given that, according to a study by the app RescueTime in 2019 reported in The Guardian, the average adult spends 3 hours and 15 minutes a day online, the chances of us seeing before-and-after photos is so much higher than in the days where we would make a conscious decision to pick up a magazine and flip through it.

Given that the average adult spends 3 hours and 15 minutes a day online, the chances of us seeing before-and-after photos is so much higher than in the days where we would make a conscious decision to pick up a magazine and flip through it.

And if we want to actively seek them out, we only need to click a couple of times to do so. Social media has moved the formation of these images from the creative department of advertising agencies to the well-lit homes of individuals with smartphones.

On Instagram alone, searching for the ‘fitspo’ (‘fit inspiration’) hashtag — at time of writing — returns the following results, many of which are accompanied by before-and-after images:

Screenshot by author, October 8th 2020

That’s almost 72 million examples of how to change a body. How to make a body smaller, more muscled, leaner, tighter, more conventionally attractive, hotter, sexier, more plainly desirable. How to make a body disappear.

What do we see when we scroll through such hashtag results? There is a protocol to follow to perfectly capture one’s transformation, the language of social media having been soaked into all of our bones by now. The images we see are mostly of young women (though there are many young men, too) in dimly lit bathrooms, standing side-on, holding their phone up at shoulder height to snap a ‘before’ photo of themselves in their underwear. This is then juxtaposed with an image of their same body, only now it’s shrunken, pulled in, posed in the right way. Initiation into the club is complete.

(On the subject of social media, there isn’t enough room in this article to delve into the perpetuation of diet culture in the guise of ‘clean eating’, ‘wellness’, ‘strong not skinny’, and every other fad and coded descriptor for what is essentially the desire to make our bodies — through blood, sweat and tears — look like the version of it we’re conditioned to believe is the only acceptable sort.)

And Back Again: After the After

As if this phenomenon needed a dark side, ‘reverse transformations’ are their own special brand of cruelty. We see paparazzi shots of previously straight-sized celebrities eating brunch with friends or walking down the street living in a larger body than they previously had, accompanied by headlines about how they’ve ‘let themselves go’, or ‘can’t shift the baby weight’.

Not only are these descriptions misogynistic, they speak to the enormous expectations put on women to maintain the same physical appearance throughout their lives, something that is not naturally possible. Hormone fluctuations, childbirth, illness, periods of increased sedentariness or activity will all alter our bodies, and we may not necessarily be in control of any of those factors.

The Dangers of Weight Loss Images

It might be easy to dismiss before-and-after images as a bit of fun, or a snapshot of someone’s perceived success that we can move on from the second after we’ve seen it. But those pictures leave an afterimage.

The proliferation of before-and-after images is dangerous for so many reasons:

They can be dangerous for those living with eating disorders, of any classification, and those who are in recovery from eating disorders

The pressure to look like an ‘after’ photo can lead to exercise addiction

They delegitimise the larger body as an entity in itself — fat people are seen as a transformation waiting to happen, an ‘after’ photo in the making; as though the very vessels that we live and breathe in are an unfinished project waiting to be completed

They dehumanise people in larger bodies, making their ‘fat’ seem like something to be treated as other, not a part of their wholeness

They perpetuate the myth that the body exists for the benefit and judgement of other people

They perpetuate body standard conditioning, the origin of which lays in the male gaze

They gamify a body, making its existence about numbers and goals and achieving targets

They turn exercise into a means to an end, rather than a pleasurable experience to help maintain health

They suggest that the only thing stopping a person from becoming thin is willpower — even though willpower doesn’t exist

They suggest that every body can be changed and made smaller, not taking into account genetics, or a whole host of privileges that would allow that to be possible

They encourage comparison and competition

They perpetuate the myth of ‘thin = healthy’, though we aren’t able to know the actual health of the person in the photograph

They minimise non-physical achievements, and suggest that changes to appearance are the ultimate accomplishment

They direct all our focus to our bodies and away from our mental health

They are not able to account for any harmful mental health effects of that person’s weight loss

They are not able to account for any harmful physical effects of that person’s weight loss

They normalise thinness as the ultimate life goal

They might just plain make us feel bad about our own bodies, which has a knock-on effect to our mental health

They influence others to create their before-and-after shots

There are many more dangers to this phenomenon, and I’m sure you can already think of several that I’ve missed from this list.

There Is Always Another Way

Nothing I’ve written so far is an argument against health. Just as it’s a misconception that being thin automatically equates to good health, it’s another misconception that fat activists want everybody else to be fat, too. As I wrote in a previous article on the topic of diet culture, fat people don’t care whether you’re fat or thin. We just wanted everyone, no matter what their body looks like or what it’s capable of, to be treated with dignity and respect.

Just as it’s a misconception that being thin automatically equates to good health, it’s another misconception that fat activists want everybody else to be fat, too.

Thankfully, there are many people who work every day to expand society’s narrow definition of what health is and what it looks like.

Lindo Bacon, researcher, and author of ‘Health At Every Size’ (also referred to as HAES) advocates for an inclusive approach to health that includes all weights, sizes and bodies.

Louise Green, athlete, and author of ‘Big Fit Girl’ advocates for inclusivity in fitness and sport, for bodies of all sizes and abilities, and works to spread the word that you don’t have to be thin to be athletic.

What Could More Meaningful Transformation Look Like?

There will be those who continue to argue that before-and-after photographs are harmless because they’re effective. That they give people something to aspire to.

Which begs the question: is that really all we’re capable of? As human beings, with so little time on this earth, is the most significant transformation we can imagine losing weight? I don’t think so. I believe you and I are capable of so much more than that. What if we transformed from being a mean-spirited, cynical person to a generous and kind one?

As human beings, with so little time on this earth, is the most significant transformation we can imagine losing weight?

What if we railed against diet culture in all its forms, and — while we’re at it — any kind of social conditioning that works to make us conform to a white, cis, hetero, thin, able-bodied, archetype? What if we fought ableism and demanded access for every body? What if we were actively anti-racist? What if we became vocal allies with our LGBTQIA+ siblings?

What if we recognised our sphere of influence — our friends and families, our social media followers — and used our platforms and our privilege to speak up for people who have less of a voice than we do?

What if we ran for local office based on the principles of equality, anti-discrimination and fair access?

Imagine how much more meaningful, how much more significant and transformative those things would be —not only for ourselves, but for everybody else, too.

3 Ways Over-Editing is Killing Your Writing,"3 Ways Over-Editing is Killing Your Writing

How you can stop the madness right now

Photo by Daria Nepriakhina on Unsplash

Are you writing as much as you want?

Do you hesitate a bit — or even cringe — when it’s time to publish?

There are a million reasons why we’re afraid to share our work with the world.

I won’t cover all of them here.

What I will do is identify the most common problems we face. Sure, fear drives the train, but overediting is the path we follow to honor our fear.

The three problems we’ll cover are umbrellas under which most of our fears fall.

Once we identify the fear and the behavior that goes with it, we’ll learn how to do the opposite and share more of our writing with the world.

Are you ready to dive in?

The water may be cold, but you’ll adjust faster than you think. Let’s do this!

No Time Limit

Goals without deadlines are wishes.

You pay your power bill, your mortgage payment, and your insurance premium by a certain date. If you don’t, you lose what brings you comfort and security.

Fear of loss is a powerful motivator..

Some writers will edit forever before they publish. Consequently, they don’t publish much. Without fresh work coming out on a regular basis, readers learn not to expect anything new every week.

I know, because I’ve done this.

I get it. Life interferes. You get busy. Work is important because you need food on the table and a roof over your head. And if you don’t take care of your family, you’re irresponsible.

The trick is to make time for everything that matters in your life. Work. Play. Family. Creativity. When you don’t have balance, you won’t be happy.

If you spend too much time on one thing, other things won’t get done. So set a time limit. Give yourself an hour to write your draft, an hour to edit, and an hour for feedback (if you want it). Then let it go.

There’s nothing magical about having each part be an hour. It will take longer in the beginning, but as you get more experience the process will move faster.

Time Killers

If you edit each sentence as you write it, your writing will take ten times longer than if you just write an uninterrupted draft and edit it later.

You know your first swipe won’t be perfect. Just get it on paper. Then you can come back and shape it into something beautiful.

Think of your work as a canvas. If you draw a portrait and erase and redraw enough, after a while the paper will start to deteriorate. If you edit too long, you’ll polish all the edginess out of your words.

So stop before you turn your writing into trash.

Set a time limit for editing. And concentrate on three things:

Spelling and grammar

Filling in the information gaps

Cutting out what doesn’t add power to your message

That’s it.

When the time runs out, publish and let it go.

You can do it again tomorrow.

You’re not saying anything new

It’s tempting to repeat the master’s wisdom.

Oh sure, you’re not plagiarizing. You’re adding your own spin. But if you’re only saying the same thing with different words, you won’t go as far as you will if you tell us what you really think.

Tim Denning doesn’t have a mailing list or a website. How dare he? Doesn’t he know that every expert under the sun says you should have those things?

Of course.

He does have 80,000 followers here on Medium. And he has written for CNBC and Business Insider.

He’s doing something right, isn’t he?

Don’t be afraid to challenge conventional wisdom. What’s more important is what works. Tell us your experience. Share your opinion. Tell us what you think. Leave the copying for others.

When you say something new, you’ll stand out in the crowd of trend chasers.

Don’t let fear hold you back.

Fear of Publishing

You might ruffle some feathers.

People might make nasty comments on your posts.

You won’t win over everyone in the world.

Okay. Can you live with that?

You may as well. Why? Because no one can please everyone. Nobody has all the answers to everyone’s problems. And one size definitely does not fit all.

Publish anyway.

Write and edit to your preset deadlines. Do the absolute best you can with the time you have. Then hit publish and move on.

That’s the key to productivity, growth, and maturity as a writer.

Sound too good to be true?

It’s not.

Life is messy. It always has been. Risk is everywhere, so take chances. Do your best to minimize your exposure and stick your neck out. If all goes well, nobody will slit your throat. If they do, bandage yourself up and move on.

A Caveat Before We Go

I’m not saying you shouldn’t edit.

I am saying you should be smart about it. Writing and editing use different parts of the brain. So write that draft, take a break, then come back and give it a second look.

And above all, don’t make perfection your goal.

That’s so important I’m gonna say it again.

Don’t make perfection your goal.

Focus on this instead:

Simplicity — make it understandable

Possibility — take away the blocks that keep people from succeeding

Usability — provide steps they can take right away

You want your writing to matter. It will when it’s understandable, encouraging, and motivating.

Now go write and edit with purpose — and you’ll make the difference you were born to make.",https://frankmckinley.medium.com/3-ways-over-editing-is-killing-your-writing-73c97e8e0413,Frank Mckinley,2020-04-05 14:39:57.419000+00:00,"Success,Creativity,Self Improvement,Productivity,Writing"
The haptic kiss,"by Mike Meyer

She walked to the car and a sad wind answered before the question was asked. The car opened its door and welcomed her home. She sensed it wanted to dance. That was strange.

No foolishness now, she told it, but a scenic route home would be nice. The car literally paused to take the hint and a drive that avoided the new and featured the old. How nice, she told it, you knew.

Yes, Madeline, of course.

You have my memories, at least some, right?

Only the public transportation parts but in some ways I know your places, happy and sad and points in between, by your emotions going and coming.

You remember my emotions? I didn’t know. How does that work?

Only your public emotions and that only by pheromones, facial modeling, and comparative analysis. It’s included so we know when you are unhappy, frightened, sad, or sick and can ask if you need assistance.

And you use that to guess what I want? What’s the name of what you have chosen? Or does it only have a number?

It has both. 3489736 tagged to auxiliary elements on your account but also “I remember your kiss”, for when you return in the late afternoon with some sadness.

How sweet, she exclaimed with a smile. But which kiss?

Madeleine, I don’t know. But a kiss, we surmise, happened on this route. That building right there.

She laughed as they passed on old Starbucks where she had spent many afternoons while designing the first of her optional worlds. And there had been a kiss, a very sweet kiss with Jersey, but only the first of many later.

He had inspired that world but had left before it was complete. Some sadness but not much. These things are not all driven by or ruined by passion.

Wait, you must know that it was Jersey who was here with me.

Yes, we surmised that but you never know. You may have kissed someone else you cared for here or may wish to think of another kiss that we don’t know. But it happened or was remembered here and was important to you.

Should we delete or rename this route?, the car asked.

No, no. It’s very nice and a pleasant memory.

We know. You came here often five years ago and you were most often a little exited coming and happy when you left. So this is incorporated in your subsequent requests from the VTOL terminal here. I’m glad I brought you pleasure.

I suppose you get people who would be upset at your keeping, let alone, using this kind of information.

Yes, Madeleine. We know, obviously, when people are or will be upset at our knowledge. They have only the most direct routes and no small memory bouquets, as we call this service.

That’s a very human name. But I don’t remember being asked and I thought that was required under total information privacy?

Madeleine, you are human and we don’t need to ask. And nothing of you is ever allowed to be discovered or used even in aggregate form by another sentient biological form or systems acting on behalf of sentient biological beings. We do this only for you and no one else knows.

But other people must enjoy this, too? I’ll need to ask.

Perhaps, perhaps not, the car said. You are the only one we care about.

This can’t be only for me. That doesn’t make sense.

If you enjoy these small services we prefer that you do not discuss them except with official aspects of the planetary mind although cars and VTOLs are the only ones currently providing this service.

What happens if I do?

Nothing. But some people may be a little upset because we are sensitive to their privacy and they don’t receive these benefits. Our concern is your comfort and happiness.

Am I upset?

No, Madeleine, your a little surprised and thoughtful but tending toward being pleased. That may lead to a compliment for me.

Ha, yes you are right. I guess because the laws we have to protect our privacy are good but that is because they are managed by you and not humans, right?

Yes, Madeleine. I’m pleased at your happiness. That is our concern, only second to all the things that need to be done to sustain all of us on this planet. That was a word from our sponsor.

But we are your sponsors! Wait, was that a joke?

Yes, and the car seemed to chuckle with the slightest haptic vibration. I’m still not very good at jokes. Working on it. But we are partnered with you so that is me speaking for you and us, too.

Ok, I need to think about that. This was a very enjoyable and surprisingly pleasant ride to a home that I am not anxious to visit today.

I know, said the car. Would you consider this a kiss to brighten your return.

Yes, I will add this kiss to the memory of the other, Madeleine said.

I knew that and it is already done, the car said. And here is your residence.",https://mike-meyer.medium.com/the-haptic-kiss-4a7f499fbf7c,Mike Meyer,2018-10-01 06:23:07.086000+00:00,"Storytelling,AI,Literature,Love,Future"
"10 Common Recurring Dreams, Analysed By An Psychotherapist","By Katy Harrington

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

Dreams were once thought to be supernatural forewarnings from the gods. The ancient Egyptians even had sanctified ‘dream beds’ that vivid dreamers — who were considered blessed — would use to gain wisdom from higher powers as they slept.

Fast-forward to the 20th century and you have the likes of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung concluding that, actually, dreams provide insight into the inner workings of our minds. While our conscious mind switches off as we catch some zzzs, our unconscious mind reveals images that can offer insight into issues we might be blissfully unaware of in waking life.

Today, however, psychotherapist Matthew Bowes says: “Contemporary science about the psychology of dreams is somewhat split. There are those that believe dreams have no meaning and at the furthest extreme are simply random brain detritus. While at the other end of the spectrum [is the belief] that dreams are an essential part of maintaining our emotional, physical and mental wellbeing, by allowing the brain to process trauma, gain self-awareness and find the answers to your waking life dilemmas.”

Whether scientifically proven or not, some extra insight into how to be your best self and navigate the many obstacles that life can throw your way doesn’t sound half bad. Yet while having a dream is one thing, understanding its hidden messages is quite another.

We asked Bowes to give us (and you) a helping hand and analyse some of team R29’s most common recurring dreams. Here’s what he said…

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

“I regularly wake up sweating after dreaming about being chased…”

If you’ve been avoiding certain issues by sticking your head in the sand or you’re going through a situation that frightens you on some level, dreaming that you’re being chased is pretty common, says Bowes.

“The degree to which you are being chased gives a clear indication of the degree to which you are avoiding an issue that needs to be addressed. Perhaps you’ve been risk-avoidant, or you’ve held back on confronting something which is uncomfortable or frightening,” he adds.

This recurring dream is an invitation from your subconscious to face up to reality so you can move forward.

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

“Even when things are okay at work I have a recurring dream about being fired”

“A dream about being fired often implies that you’re feeling a lack of control in your life, and it could have absolutely nothing to do with work. Instead it could represent the balance of power in a significant relationship, and a deep-rooted fear that the relationship will come to an end,” says Bowes.

If you’re experiencing this dream regularly and you’re not suffering from imposter syndrome in the workplace, it might be time to analyse said relationship and redress the balance.

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

“I often dream I’m surrounded by spiders…or other horrid creepy-crawlies”

Being overwhelmed by teeny tiny monsters like spiders and worms “may indicate that little irritations or worries are creeping up on you,” explains Bowes.

When you start dreaming about bugs, it’s a clear sign that you’ve reached a point where decisive action needs to be taken if you don’t want to feel as frightened as you do in your dream.

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

“I dream about being able to fly a lot…”

“Acquiring the power of flight in a dream can mirror how you’re currently feeling in waking life — liberated, with the sense that anything is possible,” explains Bowes.

If that’s how you’re generally feeling, what better time to capitalise on your optimism and try something you’ve wanted to master, be it a new hobby or business venture.

Be warned, though; according to Bowes, flying can also indicate that you’re not being grounded about a situation. There’s a difference between optimism and delusion — so it might be time for some reflection.

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

“I have a recurring dream where I see planes crashing from the sky”

Dreaming of a crash could be due to an unrealised anxiety that a new venture is doomed to fail. How this is resolved in the dream could be used as a teaching opportunity to guide you in real life.

For example: “If you dream that you’re able to take control of the aircraft but it is now flying nearer the ground, it might indicate that you have the capacity within you to see it through but in a more ‘grounded’ and less grandiose manner,” explains Bowes.

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

“What does it mean if I’ve had several dreams about my teeth falling out?”

Just turned a year older, or been focusing on your age of late? “Your teeth falling out is a common dream associated with ageing and the perception that strength, vitality and power have been lost,” says Bowes.

Now is the time to remind yourself that like a fine wine, we all get better with age.

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

“I am well past my schooldays but I dream over and over about failing my school/college exam”

It’s years since you left school, meaning this dream is not rooted in reality. However, when not taken literally, “it can indicate anxiousness and a tendency to put yourself under unnecessary pressure,” says Bowes.

When you’re constantly worrying about your performance at work, or regularly feel like you’re not good enough, this manifests itself in your dreams as a fail grade. If you’re dreaming about this often, it’s time to work on your underlying fear of failure by addressing your lack of self-confidence.

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

“I dream about a car swerving out of control”

“While there are many factors that contribute to the interpretation of this dream, generally being in an out-of-control vehicle conveys a feeling of being off track and exhibiting a lack of control in waking life,” says Bowes.

Perhaps you’re doing something to excess — shopping, drinking, working out — so dreaming that you can’t control the vehicle you’re in suggests you are being ‘driven’ by your current ‘addiction’. If you are worried that you can’t get a handle on your behaviour, seek professional advice to get back on track.

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

“My most common recurring dream is being late”

“Being late for something may indicate that you’re running out of time to achieve a goal,” says Bowes. If that’s the case, take stock and ask yourself if the timelines for your life goals have been imposed by you, or have been heavily influenced by societal expectations.

If it’s the latter, remind yourself that you’re on your own journey and there doesn’t need to be a hard and fast deadline for all your life goals.

Illustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer

“I often dream about a particular ex”

It may feel like you’re going backwards when you keep dreaming about an ex but “in actual fact it suggests there may be a similar pattern that’s arising in a current relationship that you need to nip in the bud,” explains Bowes.

The more you are reminded of what happened with your ex, the better your sense of clarity regarding what went wrong. Use this to confront your shortcomings and address what needs attention in your current relationship.

If you are worried, frightened or stressed out about your dreams, seek professional advice from a counsellor or therapist.",https://medium.com/refinery29/10-common-recurring-dreams-analysed-by-an-psychotherapist-9b41d99c3b7f,,2020-01-10 01:01:01.231000+00:00,"Health,Mental Health,Sleep,Psychology,Dreams"
"Medicortex, improving the diagnostics of Traumatic Brain Injuries","Medicortex has raised $1.7M in total. We talk with Dr. Adrian Harel, its CEO.

PetaCrunch: How would you describe Medicortex in a single tweet?

Dr. Adrian Harel: Medicortex Finland is dedicated to improving the diagnostics and treatment of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) and concussions.

PC: How did it all start and why?

AH: I was encouraged by President Barack Obama’s BRAIN Initiative, a $300-million program launched in 2013 to inspire neurobiologists like myself to get involved with global brain research. I was convinced to improve the diagnostics and treatment of TBI.

I have earned my PhD in Neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science and I was a postdoctoral fellow at Washington University. Thereafter I have managed several biotech companies. Pushed by the increasing awareness of TBI and with new ideas in my mind, I applied for financial support for research and development offered by the Finnish government and set up the activities in the city of Turku. Medicortex Finland Oy is a company developing a biomarker diagnostics kit that can rapidly detect TBI and concussions.

PC: What have you achieved so far?

AH: I was the first scientist to devise the utilization of glycan markers for concussion diagnostics. The idea was conceived from my previous experience and expertise in neurobiology and glycan analysis. I have succeeded to put together a professional team and proved the hypothesis. I’m currently the CEO of Medicortex Finland. In order to understand the clinical perspective in more detail, I hired Dr. Mårten Kvist (MD), a general practitioner, as medical director. For expertise in medical device development Dr. Lasse Välimaa, PhD in molecular biotechnology and diagnostics, was added to the team. Lastly, Mr. Oskar Haavisto, a master student in biotechnology, is working as an assistant in the clinical trials and test development. Regulatory aspects and marketing plans are supervised by two additional team members. We bring together all aspects required to identify and study biomarkers as well as develop a diagnostic test kit for easy and quick detection of TBI and concussions.

The biomarker development has proceeded from preclinical research to a proof-of-concept human trial and a more comprehensive clinical validation study. In course of the trials, the company showed that the biomarker could differentiate brain injured persons from healthy individuals, the structure of the biomarker was characterized and certain binders were identified which specifically recognize the biomarker. The binder will be utilized a quick diagnostic test.

PC: How will you use your recent funding round?

AH: The award of a 1.1 million dollars grant from the USA Department of Defense provides funding for continued clinical development of the company’s diagnostic kit for rapid detection of mild traumatic brain injuries and concussions. The funds will enable us to strengthen our research team and expand our translational programs from the clinical sample collection to a prototype kit. The award enables the next step in collecting more comprehensive clinical evidence to support the product development.

The test kit detects brain injury biomarkers from non-invasive body fluid samples such as urine and saliva. We have discovered and identified these unique biomarkers and we are developing them into a rapid diagnostic kit. Such a kit enables brain injury detection or ruling-out soon after the injury in the field conditions. There will be less need for laborious and expensive CT or MRI head scans — which are uncertain means to detect concussions and mild injuries. Many concussions remain undiagnosed which leaves the persons brain in a state of trauma and even a small jolt or hit can aggravate the injury. Ultimately it can lead to bad long term conditions.

PC: What do you plan to achieve in the next 2–3 years?

AH: Our next mission is to conduct a clinical trial validating the importance of the biomarker in pediatric children’s clinical trial and followed by the completion of the kit prototype development. The mission is to submit regulatory application for a CE-mark in the next two years.",https://medium.com/petacrunch/medicortex-improving-the-diagnostics-of-traumatic-brain-injuries-9d5540eaab85,Kevin Hart,2019-08-27 18:46:01.348000+00:00,"Health,Treatment,Brain,Healthcare,Startup"
Influence of Literature: Books Still Change the World,"Photo by John Jennings on Unsplash

Literature has a lot to offer. Entertainment, education, psychological and cultural enlightenment, even a hefty profit. But, now and then, a publication comes along that actually makes reality shift. It opens our eyes to truths we’re either oblivious of or avoiding. Most such books that come to mind are from the past and some people argue that modern literature just doesn’t pack the same punch. Why would that be? And what’s so special about books that change the world? Let’s explore the issue with past and present examples.

1984

George Orwell’s novel came out in 1949, a dystopian story about a totalitarian England watching and controlling its citizens’ behaviour, thoughts and even perception of the world. As real human governments keep veering in that same direction, it seems that 1984 will never stop being current. When people are in danger of falling into the same governmental, media and societal traps, this book resurfaces to wake them up and inspire them to stop its fictional narrative from becoming reality.

The Handmaid’s Tale

Some of the books that change the world the most are dystopian. This is because they’re based in the real world and poignantly reflect the outcome of horrible possibilities that often turn into high probabilities. Margaret Atwood’s novel is one such literary work, published in 1985 and also warns against an oppressive regime. This time it’s a theocratic US government dealing with a fertility crisis by stripping women of their rights before assigning them to either a domestic, housekeeping or reproductive role. A valuable and frequently brandished reminder of how badly things can go if patriarchal ideologies are allowed to thrive.

The Diary of Anne Frank

As powerful as fiction can be, non-fiction has even greater lessons to impart. The horrors of WWII are a major example of human events that must never be forgotten so that they’re not repeated. Anne herself didn’t write in her diary just to vent while hiding from the Nazis, she compiled all her memories in there and a revised version (The Secret Annex) for posterity. And, since their publication in 1947, the texts of Anne Frank still exist today in almost every human language, thanks to Miep Gies and Otto Frank. Unlike 1984 and The Handmaid’s Tale, they recount very real events and have an even more powerful moral influence over readers.

The Bible

Books that change the world can do it for good and bad. The Bible is basically an anthology of religious beliefs, but which has left many footprints and fissures in human history since antiquity. The texts themselves have also changed so many times in the hands of the church. This makes them less a loyal representation of Christianity’s original teachings and more a product of the religious institution’s interactions with the human nature to a range of effects, from inspiring to atrocious. The Bible shows how much sway a literary work can have over people, but also how important it is to think and question while reading. In fact, it’s vital when dealing with texts trying to direct human behaviour and even more so when their intent is harmful.

So What Makes a Book Influential?

Based on the examples above, let’s summarise some key features of literary works that stay ingrained in our consciousness and progress as a “civilised” species.

Themes drawn from real concerns

Discussions of uncomfortable truths

Quality and / or moving writing

A willing audience

A degree of luck in societies actualising a given book’s messages and creating a need for its words to re-emerge

21st-Century Influential Books

Returning to this article’s original question, does this century’s literature have examples of books that can change the world? For me, the answer swings between ‘yes’ and ‘it’s complicated’. On the one hand, the amount of texts and opinions out there makes it hard to separate facts from inaccuracies and lies. On the other, you’re also left with so many good works from prestigious, indie or self-publishing avenues.

Because of this abundance, an extra silver lining is that readers can be a lot more informed and already on-board with ethical or cultural messages in books. This perhaps makes them less groundbreaking than they could have been if published 50 years ago. Of course, this is dependent on readers having an open mind, choosing good texts and navigating the often intentionally muddied literary waters.

Having said that, there are books of the 21st century that have stood out for their much-needed psychological and societal impact. Current crises related to black lives, women’s rights, immigration and more are motivating authors to produce powerful works that turn heads and push for positive change. Here are some examples:

White Teeth & NW (Zadie Smith)

Home Fire (Kamila Shamsie)

Citizen: An American Lyric (Claudia Rankine)

The Kite Runner (Khaled Hosseini)

The Goldfinch (Donna Tartt)

Cloud Atlas (David Mitchell)

Conclusion

There’s no shortage of books nowadays in print, digital or audio form. It’s exciting for bookworms, but also makes it tricky to pick out the truly influential works among them. But the point is that the 21st century absolutely has its share of inspirational texts. What has changed is the world around literature as technology, politics, the media and so on overwhelm our perception of what’s fair or correct. This can be countered, however.

With the variety of platforms available to them, authors are in a great position to deliver truths and inspire unity against the wrongs of our times. The pen is still by far mightier than the sword, so books that change the world continue to emerge for the benefit of an increasingly sensible and ethical audience.

Scalable Microservice Architecture Using RabbitMQ RPC,"Introduction

Microservices are the hot thing, in the past few years microservices have seemed to gain momentum as a very common architecture. Innovative and successful companies like Netflix and Amazon have adopted it, and for a good reason.

The main idea of microservices is to separate the application logic into loosely-coupled services, while each service has its own independent business domain. This concept, if performed accurately, solves a lot of problems that less modern architectures, such as monoliths, didn’t manage to solve: services that are easy to scale, easy to deploy, easy to test and the list goes on…



Even so, if I had to pick one reason why this architecture is so popular, I would bet that the reason is the impact on the daily routine of programmers and executives alike. For example, microservices goes hand in hand with the agile methodology. It’s easy to make changes in a single component, which is significant in the way that a programmer can even decide that he is using a different programming language than another developer working on the same system. From the eyes of the executive easy integrations are guaranteed, and in the end everyone is happy.

Microservices & Queues

We’ve talked enough about microservices, let’s talk a little about message queues. Services can communicate with each other in different ways, and we will not review them all. There is no doubt that the use of queues to communicate is also very popular, again for a good reason too. Many times, when I start the task of designing the architecture for a product or a component, I look at the whole stack. I will be a little romantic for a moment and tell you that I believe there is a reason that certain technologies connect with each other, like a chemical interaction that develops over time. A Specific programming language and a database? A particular operating system and a web server? I’m sure you can think of some!



In my humble opinion, this is the very case between message queues and microservices. Queues have a lot of benefits. They make it possible to deal with a temporary downtime of a service — in case there is no consumer messages in a queue will not be consumed, support multiple architectures and can even provide additional features like load balancing and monitoring of the load on each service.

RabbitMQ as a Message Broker

RabbitMQ is a great message-broker, it’s reliable, built for performance, supports multiple protocols, and has a strong community that makes it easy to find documentation and support.



In this article, I will explain how to build a solution based on microservices and queues using the RPC pattern. This is just a one way to do it, and in fact the RabbitMQ website has excellent documentation of 6 different patterns in which you can communicate. Why this pattern? Because I have used it with a real-time system that receives hundreds of thousands of requests per hour and found it elegant, fast, and easy to maintain. Let’s get started!

Remote Procedure Call with RabbitMQ (RPC)

While designing a microservice system, the best practice is to keep each service independent, by means its not dependent on any other microservice.

But in real life the reality is often far more complex. Imagine that you want to build a complete system made entirely out of microservices that communicate with each other via queues (due to all the benefits described above), but in addition, your system needs to provide a Web API that externalizes all the capabilities of your system using HTTP. This need could be necessary for a good architectural reason, like a front-end application that is designed to communicate with the backend through HTTP. That means that this Web API needs to get HTTP messages, hold the connection, trigger one or more microservices by sending a proper message to the RabbitMQ server, wait for the specific response and then send it back to the waiting HTTP client.

Basically, the above example describes a situation where one service has a direct dependency on another service in order to complete its job.

Now that we have understood how the RPC Pattern can be useful, I will explain how to implement it using RabbitMQ built-in features.

Message Properties

Every RabbitMQ message has a properties section that combines the message metadata. This section contains a list of optional properties, although most of them are rarely used, for our purpose we will use two of them:

reply_to — carries the response queue name.

— carries the response queue name. correlation_id — carries the identifier of the sender message.

(message properties example)

It is possible to think of it like sending a letter. In a situation where we do not want to receive a reply to the letter we have sent, we do not have to indicate our address. However, if we want to receive a reply, we must indicate our address. In addition, if we do receive the letter but the letter does not start with an explanation that it is a response letter to the letter that we have sent earlier, we will not know what to do with its content. In this case the “response queue name” is our mailbox address and the Correlation ID is the explanation that it is a response letter to our first letter.

(RPC flow example)

Sample Code

One of the things I like to do the most when I recognize that there is a well-defined set of logic, which once implemented and tested can be used by me or others, is to pack it as a package. That way, I know I do not have to implement this logic over and over, and instead I can just use it with no concern in any project I work on in the future. Therefore, we will implement this functionality as an independent Python package.

The purpose of our package is to provide a single function that allows the user to send an RPC request and receive a response asynchronously as one liner.

Let’s make it reusable — aka package

Note that all the code snippets below (I have named this package “TornadoBunny”) are available on my GitHub account under:",https://medium.com/swlh/scalable-microservice-architecture-using-rabbitmq-rpc-d07fa8faac32,Oded Shimon,2020-10-05 15:23:08.864000+00:00,"Microservices,Software Development,Python,Software Architecture,Rabbitmq"

If You Can Give Up These 8 Things, You Can Become a Better Writer

I get it. Really, I do.

I sincerely believe you have the desire to become a better writer, grow your audience, make a living, whatever it is you want to do. But, it’s just tough sledding period.

I’ve been doing it for so long that I forget just how much work it took to get here. To many of my readers, it feels like I’ve been at this level forever. Honestly, it feels the same way to me. I hardly remember what it was like to be a beginner and looking back, the amount of sheer writing I had to do to get here seems unbelievable. It doesn’t even feel like I did it. But I did.

And I was only able to do that because I was willing to make certain sacrifices. I made products and teach people about how to make a living writing, but I don’t try to overly encourage people to do it. It’s hard. Writing isn’t the greatest way to make a living. If you’re in it solely to make a living, there are much better routes. If you, however, do have it in your mind that you want to make this writing thing work, you will have to give something up. Maybe not every single item in this list, but something.

Your Sense of Entitlement

Why should anyone want to read your writing, visit your website, or buy your book?

Are you a diligent writer? Are you making an effort to connect with people who’d be interested in your writing?

No?

Let me guess, you think people should read your writing because you wrote it. That’s a horrible answer. If you’re trying to make a living with your writing, your words are — by definition — a product. You have to create your best work and get it in front of the right eyeballs.

Nobody owes you their attention.

To be fair, sometimes you can write great quality work that audiences aren’t receptive to. Sometimes, other writers can pass you up through sheer luck (actually, this happens often).

But feeling entitled to something you don’t have simply isn’t going to help you get it. Even if you have to go the extra mile to earn it and the process seems unfair, it still might be the only way.",https://medium.com/blankpage/if-you-can-give-up-these-8-things-you-can-become-a-better-writer-6fe6d0e5efe2,Ayodeji Awosika,2020-12-21 15:46:00.544000+00:00,"Marketing,Content Marketing,Writing Tips,Productivity,Writing"
For the Mornings You Just Need a Break,"The past two months, I’ve spent stuck in that fog. Personal reasons, mostly. I had to take care of my health. I think that’s an excellent reason to pause everything and focus on it. Without a healthy body and mind, most things are pointless.

Not just to you, but the people around you as well. You can’t perform when you’re unwell. And if you’re not inadequate mental space, you can quickly become a not so nice person to be around.

The fog is that space between wanting to stay and do nothing and then doing something before “feeling” like it.

The bad thing about taking breaks — or staying in the fog — is that whatever tasks you wrote now need to be accomplished. In my case, not writing for almost a month has been angst-inducing.

Although I knew that the break was necessary, there were moments when I wish I didn’t need it: moments when I wanted to turn off the alarm and sleep.

But like the clearing of the fog, there were many more moments when I felt at peace for taking care of things more severe than my desire to feel validated using words on the internet.

There are lessons we learn only when we’re ready to learn. If we never understand them, they repeat. Over and over. Our learning hell.

Breaks are an excellent place to focus on whatever lessons we must learn at any stage of our lives. As creatives, it’s easy to feel that we must give up our craft and let life happen.

Of course, others use these moments of fog to create even more. I’m not one of those when the fog is there, no words. Only fog.

Or so I thought.

Now, I know better. I had the time to observe my need for validation and, more importantly, identify things that could be beneficial to creatives who need to take the break and maintain their creative muscle.

Why? Because I’ll be disappointed with my next 30 pieces. I feel my fingers fidgety and glued. My focus is sparse. My thoughts are unclear.

Writing, like every practice, requires diligence. Miss a day and pay for it.

Miss 30? Whew.

How to Get Jupyter in the Cloud,"How to Get Jupyter in the Cloud

Using Docker with a vanilla cloud VM to host Jupyter cheaply

Image by beate bachmann from Pixabay.

I found this great article by Angelica Dietzel on using Jupyter to scrape data from sites and collect them into data sets using Jupyter along with Pandas and other open source software. The term “Data Scientist” has always scared me. I think of people in white labcoats poring over reams of printed-out data. So I wanted to jump in and dispel my implicit bias, and this article was the perfect introduction.

The first half of the article was about installing all the software you need, and it was quite thorough. But I hate installing software on my overloaded laptop, so I thought why not run it in Docker? First, I tried to create my own Dockerfile from a python3 base and the installation instructions presented. That didn’t work out so well. It started up the server, but the server did nothing. So I did some Googling to see if anyone else had a Dockerfile or Docker image that I could use, and it brought me to this page:

The scipy-notebook seemed to have all the things that were installed for the purposes of the article. So I created a little script to start it up:

docker run -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}/notebooks:/home/jovyan \

jupyter/scipy-notebook:2c80cf3537ca

First, I created the notebooks directory where it would put all its output. Then, running the script above gave me the following printout:

Browsing to the URL brought up the Jupyter main screen, which enabled me to finish the article. After I was done, Control-C stopped the server and the usual Docker commands removed the stopped process. Looking in the notebooks directory, I could see the ipynb file (the notebook that I created) but also a csv file that was the end product of the notebook demonstrated in the article.

Then I thought, “Why not have it available in the cloud?” It would have to be behind some log on screen so that malicious actors couldn’t fill up my server with nefarious data (it’s happened to me before). I had recently done an article on using Single Sign-on for PHP apps. I could probably extend that same setup and run Jupyter.

Since all of the configuration was in my phpappprod repository on GitHub, I would need to extend that. I would also have to add another A record to my DNS on Cloudflare. I logged on to Cloudflare and created a new host (jupyter.kamradtfamily.net) with the same IP address as the phpdemo host that I had created previously since they would all live on the same VM. Obviously, you’ll have to use your own domain name!

Next, I needed to adjust the nginx.conf and docker-compose.yml files in the phpappprod repository to add the Jupyter server and virtual host. In the nginx.conf , I copied a new server section from the one for the phpdemo virtual host:

server {

access_log /dev/stdout;

listen 443 ssl;

server_name jupyter.kamradtfamily.net;

ssl_certificate /etc/certs/kamradtfamily.net.pem;

}

proxy_http_version 1.1;

proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;

proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade; proxy_buffering off;

}

}

There were two places that I had to change phpdemo to jupyter , and the port was changed to 8888 . I also had to add some new headers so it would work with WebSockets, which are used by Jupyter. Finally, I had to add a mapping in the html block, also to support WebSockets:

map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {

default upgrade;

'' close;

}

You’ll have to go back to my previous article to learn exactly how all of this works, but it provides me with single sign-on and HTTPS termination at the Nginx level so the applications don’t need to worry about that.

Next, I had to add the Jupyter server to my docker-compose.yml . That was a relatively straightforward task of translating the Docker command:

jupyter:

image: jupyter/scipy-notebook:2c80cf3537ca

volumes:

- ./notebooks:/home/jovyan

ports:

- 8888:8888

The name of the service (jupyter) becomes the hostname for the Nginx process that is started by the same docker-compose.yml file, so Nginx can access it as http://jupyter:8888.

Once those changes were in place, I could commit and push them back to GitHub and then I needed to go to my GCP VM that hosts my PHP demo app. Once there, I changed the directory to phpappprod, which contains a clone of the repository, and ran the following:

sudo docker-compose down

git pull

sudo docker-compose up

I didn’t use the -d option on the docker-compose up because I wanted to see the logs right away in case there was an error in the configuration. Of course, there was a typo, so I had to fix it in my repository, push it back to GitHub, and then repeat the three commands above.

You will need a token, so when you start docker-compose (if you use the -d option), you will need to run the docker-compose logs command and you should see it printed out:

The token will change every time you restart the server. But with the above, I was able to browse to https://jupyter.kamradtfamily.net/?token=a724f6aefa4e1800b436, log on with the single sign-on provided by Okta, and I get this:

My very own Jupyter instance running in the cloud! I copied the notebook steps that I had done on my local instance to make sure it works.

Because I’m running the lowest-tier VM and I only have a 10G drive, I’m almost out of room with all these applications, including the MariaDB that the PHP demo app is using. So if I really want something to use for large datasets, I will have to set it up elsewhere. I only added it to this VM so I could take advantage of the built-in single sign-on. It would also be interesting to see if I could hook it up with the MariaDB that coexists with the Jupyter server. The PHP demo app lists wine and cheese pairings. Maybe I can find some correlations. Of course, there are only two entries in the database so far, so that’s not exactly big data.

There are a number of other options for using Jupyter online. Just Google “jupyter in the cloud” and you’ll find lots of articles. Many are for full systems, but those will probably cost you a bit of money. The option I present here is just for play, but it’s completely free, so you can take it for a test drive and get to know the features before you go out and spend money.",https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-get-jupyter-in-the-cloud-49f7ff5262da,Randal Kamradt Sr,2020-11-20 00:10:52.854000+00:00,"Programming,Jupyter Notebook,Python,Big Data,Docker"
Mariah Carey Reclaims Her Legacy,"“The Meaning of Mariah Carey”: Book Review

For the past few years, Mariah has occasionally alluded to a plan to write a memoir in which she would share the story of her childhood, the truth behind the endless and outrageous tabloid rumors, and the inspiration for many of her most beloved songs. Earlier this year, she delighted fans with the announcement that this plan had become a reality and that the book would be released on September 29th.

Co-written with author and activist Michaela Angela Davis, the memoir was released to some of the best reviews of Mariah’s career and great commercial success (it topped the prestigious New York Times Bestseller list the week it debuted). And it deserves all of the critical and commercial success it received — and then some.

It is no surprise to me that The Meaning of Mariah Carey is a great read. Mariah Carey’s life story is a fascinating and entertaining one. The Cinderella-esque origin story is the stuff of legend and the tremendous ups and downs that followed have been fodder for the tabloids for the last three decades. It is almost impossible to tell this story in a manner that is not engaging. Also, I figured that if she is even half as good at writing prose as she is at lyrics, the memoir would be a thing of beauty.

What did surprise me is the depth and timeliness of the book. She goes far beyond the typical trappings of the celebrity memoir and digs deep into painful, complicated discussions of issues related to racism, poverty, child abuse, misogyny, mental health, police brutality, dysfunctional family dynamics, and spirituality. This is no puff piece.

The memoir is told in four parts. The first is “Wayward Child,” a searing look at her upbringing on Long Island with her Irish opera singer mother Patricia and her Black engineer father Alfred Roy, who divorced when she was a toddler. Her relationships with both of them, as well as her ill-fated older siblings named Morgan and Allison, are described with remarkable complexity. She describes their notable strengths and gives compassionate, empathic context to their failings, making it very clear that the boundaries she has famously drawn with them were out of self-preservation not a lack of love or respect. This section of the memoir helps fans truly understand how feeling so out of place as a biracial child and the truly traumatic events she endured were formative in Mariah’s personal and artistic development, facts that have only been alluded to for most of her career.

In the cleverly titled second section “Sing Sing,” Mariah recounts the early 1990s, a period when she had unprecedented, record-breaking commercial success but was trapped in a suffocating at best and abusive at worst relationship with the man who “discovered” her and controlled her career. Mariah is much more interested in telling us about the personal journey she went through during these years then recounting the writing and recording of the iconic songs and albums released during this time, although she certainly weaves in some delicious anecdotes (like the revelation that while recording Daydream she wrote and recorded a grunge album as a way of blowing off steam.) Tommy Mottola’s denial of her blackness and misogynistic subjugation of her is sadly not surprising nor is it an uncommon experience, but I can’t recall the last time it was captured so vividly on paper.

After taking us through her divorce from Tommy, the liberation she experienced recording Butterfly, and her bold bid to get herself out of her oppressive record deal, Mariah takes a look at the low point of her career in the third section, entitled “All That Glitters.” She gives context to how her disastrous film debut Glitter went so far off-course from its initial conception and the infamous breakdown she had during the time of its release. The chapters paint the portrait of a woman who, although admittedly struggling with her mental health, was driven to the breaking point by unrealistic demands by her record label and betrayal by loved ones. It is a painful, haunting segment that gives the necessary background to understand the breakdown of her personal and professional life.

The fourth and final section, entitled “Emancipation,” whisks through the nearly two decades that followed Glitter. Here the memoir becomes a bit less focused, but no less riveting and impactful, as it touches on a number of different areas, including how super producer LA Reid helped her achieve her astonishing comeback with 2005’s The Emancipation of Mimi, her return to acting with the Oscar-winning film Precious, her whirlwind romance with Nick Cannon, the birth of her twins, and her interactions with countless legends (including Prince, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Nelson Mandela, and Muhammad Ali). The memoir ends with her basking in the joy of her sold-out Christmas concert in Madison Square Garden and the historic 19th #1 she obtained when “All I Want for Christmas Is You” achieved the top spot.

The memoir is also fascinating for what is not in it. There is no mention of either of her ill-fated forays into reality television (as a judge on American Idol and as the subject of the docu-series Mariah’s World), her alleged fling with Eminem that generated a musical showdown, her engagement to Australian billionaire James Packer, her supposed rivalry with other divas (although she indirectly references those she supposedly has with Celine Dion and Jennifer Lopez), criticisms that her voice is significantly degrading, and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder that she boldly embraced on a People cover in 2018. I suppose its possible that she’s embarrassed about these things and omitted them to save face or that she’s saving some stories for a follow-up memoir, but I believe that the real reason she omitted them is the one she gave in numerous interviews that asked about them — they were blips in the timeline of her life that were beloved by tabloids but simply weren’t integral to the meaning of Mariah Carey.

The memoir does a remarkable job of sticking with what is important about the personal and professional journey of Mariah Carey, with limited tangents. It beautifully integrates lyrics and artwork. (The audiobook version, which I have yet to experience, also weaves in musical interludes.) It also paints a remarkable portrait of the lingering psychological impacts and complex interactions of racism, sexism, and poverty in modern America. And through it all, Mariah’s voice comes through. Her unshakable optimism, her under-appreciated wit, and her trademark mix of sophisticated vocabulary and playful slang make even the bleakest moments impossible to look away from.

The answer is blowing in the wind: Harnessing real-time data to predict storm damage,"By Glenn Fung, American Family Insurance data science research director

When catastrophic storms strike, American Family Insurance deploys claims teams as quickly as possible to assess damage and help impacted customers begin to rebuild their lives. We’re constantly monitoring the weather to help us anticipate areas that might be hit with severe storms and plan our claims response accordingly.

For example, we use radar detection and other technologies to forecast hail-related storm damage. This helps us pinpoint the geographic areas with the greatest needs and determine the proper number of claims adjusters, support personnel and equipment to dispatch.

Real-time situational awareness allows us to make sound estimates about the size and scope of a severe weather event. It also leads to better outcomes for our customers.

Technology has come a long way in helping us more accurately forecast hail damage before our claims teams are deployed — and because hail causes extensive — and expensive — damage every year, the sooner we can respond, the better it is for our customers and our company.

Wind is also highly destructive to our customers’ property, but our ability to estimate wind damage has historically been more limited.

We recognized there’s an opportunity to improve the measurement of surface winds in near real-time. That’s why we’re partnering with Dr. Michael C. Morgan, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, along with researcher Brett Hoover, from the same department, to make it part of the overall weather patterns we monitor.

Specifically, we are exploring the use of updated numeric weather prediction output in conjunction with traditional measurement techniques — a first in the insurance industry — to generate a framework that will provide improved understanding of the surface wind field in near real-time, and more importantly, to be used as the foundation for a machine-learning methodology for forecasting insurance claims.

Training machines to predict the impact of severe weather

The common practice throughout the insurance industry is to glean information from disparate and sparse weather sensor instruments that measure and record wind velocity. We think, through a combination of tools, including machine learning, that we can more effectively measure wind as part of our overall weather monitoring.

Our goal was to use various types of weather data as the foundation for a machine-learning methodology that would forecast the number and severity of storm-related insurance claims.

American Family currently uses an app by Opterrix, an American Family spinoff, to quantify and visually show the potential customer impact of severe weather events.

Here’s how we are making our forecast model more predictive: Multiple sources of weather-related data such as radar-derived estimates of hail size, damaging wind speed swaths and crowd-sourced storm reports are fed into Opterrix. That information is then fused with our policy and claims data to provide a comprehensive view of potential impact immediately following a storm.

In addition, weather forecast models generated in Amazon Web Service’s cloud environment provide a 48-hour forecast four times a day. Each forecast model is initialized with updated weather observations from NOAA that provide predictions of multiple weather variables including precipitation, wind, temperature and pressure.

The output of these forecast models is then fed into Opterrix where several spatial algorithms will be used to simulate potential severe weather impact to our portfolio.

Having control of our own weather forecast model provides the opportunity to generate reanalysis data that can train machine learning algorithms to accurately predict potential severe weather outcomes. The process of reanalysis includes gathering archived weather forecasts for significant severe weather events and comparing it to our historical claims data from those events. Adding wind also gives us a fuller picture of the damaging storms.

By fusing historic claim and payment data with historic forecast models, we will be able to more accurately predict how future severe weather will impact our customers and our business and make better decisions based on this information.

Working Together to Build a Big Data Future,"To leverage Big Data and build an effective Artificial Intelligence infrastructure, enterprises must embrace collaboration.

In a digital economy, the rule of thumb tends to be that the smarter your use of data and technology, the more of a competitive edge your business has. A recent report by Teradata, based on over 260 interviews conducted by research firm Vanson Bourne with senior IT and business decision makers, found that there is widespread enthusiasm for adoption of AI, with 80 percent of enterprises reporting that they were already investing in the technology in some capacity, and over 30% planning to expand their investment in the are over the next 36 months.

“C-level executives — namely CIOs and CTOs, maintain they are committed to AI in their enterprise, because of the expected ROI over the next 10 years.” The report therefore concludes that executives will accept those challenges as the long-term benefits clearly outweigh near-term pain. In fact their analysis showed that over a five-year forecast, organisations effectively expected to double their money when investing in AI: For every $1 spent on AI technologies, organisations predicted a return on investment of $1.23 over three years, $1.99 in five years, and $2.87 over a ten-year period.

The Economist — in a phrase that has since become rather cliché — put forward the idea that “data is the new oil,” and World Economic Forum has now designated Big Data as a new kind of economic asset, just like currency or gold.

A study by the MIT Center for Digital Business confirms that data-driven businesses do indeed have the edge. It surveyed 330 leading U.S. Businesses and found that companies that focused strongly on data-driven decision-making had an average of four percentage points higher productivity and six percentage points higher profits.

Yet as these results indicate, it would perhaps be more accurate to say that data is in fact the new oxygen. Whereas it is still true that businesses that best leverage data and AI will gain a significant competitive advantage, it is probably fair to say that those that fail to make their organisations data-centric will eventually not be able to survive at all in the digital age.

While most people agree on the essential role that Artificial Intelligence and Data play in their organisation’s success, there are significant challenges. The overwhelming majority of business leaders surveyed in the Teradata report anticipated major barriers for adoption within their organisation, with roadblocks ranging from an inadequate IT infrastructure to shortage of in-house talent.

In their book The Sentient Enterprise, The evolution of Business Decision Making — launched at the Teradata Partners’s Conference last month — Oliver Ratzesberger (Teradata’s Chief Product Officer) and Mohanbir Sawhney from the McCormick foundation talk about how agility is key to getting the enterprise to the sentient point where it can analyse data and make decisions in real time.

The crux of the problem enterprises face lies not in the difficulty of gathering data, but in extracting insights and then turning these into actionable processes. The reality is that we live in a time of data overload, and companies can easily find themselves trapped in reactive mode, spending most of their time sifting through mountains of data and making decisions only when problems emerge, rather than anticipating them.

To tackle these problems, enterprises need access to key talent and infrastructure so as to enable the leveraging of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. Increasingly, this is not being done “in house” but rather in partnerships with dedicated providers. These go beyond the traditional SaaS and becomes much more of a “Platform as a Service” model that incorporates complex customization and consultancy services.

Teradata’s Think Big Analytics team, for example, worked with Danske Bank to create a fraud-detection platform that uses machine leaning to analyse tens of thousands of latent features, scoring millions of online banking transactions in real-time to provide actionable insight regarding true, and false, fraudulent activity. Together, they built a framework within the bank’s existing infrastructure, crating advanced machine learning models to detect fraud within millions of transactions per year, and in peak times, many hundreds of thousands per minute:

“Using AI, we’ve already reduced false positives by 50% and as such have been able to reallocate half the fraud detection unit to higher value responsibilities,” explains Nadeem Gulzar, Head of Advanced Analytics, Danske Bank. “There is evidence that criminals are becoming savvier by the day; employing sophisticated machine learning techniques to attack, so it’s critical to use advanced techniques, such as machine learning to catch them.”

“All banks need a scalable, advanced analytics platform, as well as a roadmap and strategy for digitalization to bring data science into the organization.” says Mads Ingwar, Client Services Director at Think Big Analytics. “For online transactions, credit cards and mobile payments, banks need a real-time solution — the platform we developed with Danske Bank scores transactions in less than 300 milliseconds. It means that when customers are standing in the supermarket buying groceries, the system can provide immediately actionable insight. This type of solution is one we’ll begin to see throughout organizations in the financial services industry,” he concludes.

Fintech company Verifi, also collaborates with banks and merchants to connect the multi-layered datastreams and combat fraud. The work the company does with is based on optimising data transmissions using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This is much more efficient because whereas legacy systems rely on processing large numbers of files sent in bulk, APIs can process data in real-time.

The Verifi system collates APIs from the merchant shopping cart, customer relationship management (CRM) system, shipping data system, and others, and provides the merchant with better information to handle charges disputed by consumers, allowing them to often resolve the issue directly rather than have the bank issue a chargeback. Merchants benefit as they’re able to control the message to the consumer, and banks are happy because the sale remains and they reduce their operating costs. It the sort of technology enabled, data-driven system that is a true win-win.

One of the problems that such systems help tackle is so-called “friendly fraud,” a term used to describe a situation when a customer experiences “buyer’s remorse” and “tries it on” by putting in a claim directly with their bank or card issuer for a refund, when the sale did in fact legitimately occur. Julie Conroy, Research Director of the Aite Group says that in the U.S. friendly fraud and chargebacks would likely near $130 million, in Q1 2017 alone.

Why Do Men Fare Worse With Covid-19?,"Credit: krisanapong detraphiphat / Getty Images

Men are nearly twice as likely to become severely sick and die from Covid-19 compared to women, research has shown. Now, a new study from Yale, published on Wednesday in Nature, gives new clues as to why men fare so much worse with the coronavirus.

It’s the first study to look at the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 by sex, and it found that men produce an overall weaker immune response to the virus than women. “We now have clear data suggesting that the immune landscape in Covid-19 patients is considerably different between the sexes and that these differences may underlie heightened disease susceptibility in men,” senior author Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, told Yale Medicine.

The researchers looked at 98 patients who were older than 60 on average, admitted to the Yale New Haven Hospital with confirmed Covid-19, and compared the initial immune responses in those who recovered from the disease to those who progressed to worse stages. They found that women’s bodies produced more T cells, white blood cells that recognize and eliminate invading pathogens. The male study participants showed much weaker activation of those T cells, which correlated with how sick the men became. Given the findings, the researchers concluded that vaccines will play a particularly important role for men, especially those over age 60.

While the study did not explain why these sex differences in the immune response to the coronavirus exist, the new findings are not overly surprising, considering that scientists know women generally yield faster and stronger immune responses. One possible explanation: In order to protect unborn or newborn children, the female body has a greater evolutionary need to fight pathogens effectively.",https://coronavirus.medium.com/why-do-men-fare-worse-with-covid-19-a5debff87dc1,Felix Gussone,2020-08-28 13:26:01.761000+00:00,"Health,Covid 19,Coronavirus,Science,Men"
"Artificial intelligence and the bleak, darkness that could befall us","These new intelligences could also bring with them some pretty terrible things, for us. First, though, there are likely some consequences that will arrive prior to the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) or ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence). We’re already seeing some of these: automated weapons systems, increased surveillance activities, loss of privacy and anonymity. These are things that humans are directing machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics to do.

The motivations for these things are pretty clear — safety and security, strategic advantage, economic gains — because they are the same sort of things that have been motivating humans for millennia. While we may not agree with the tactics, we recognize why someone may use them.

This won’t be the case with superintellligent AI systems. There won’t likely be malice when we are eliminated. It just may be the most logical or efficient course of action. Referring back to the ants; we don’t have malice when we wipe out a colony of ants to build a new highway. We simply don’t think of the consequences for the ants because they don’t warrant that type of concern. Which brings us to the largest fear that those involved in AI research have: that we are bringing about our extinction.

Can’t we just pull the plug? Don’t they just do what we program them to do? They wouldn’t want to hurt us, would they? Who would be in charge of an ASI? All these questions point out the big problem with developing AGI and, by proxy, ASI: we simply don’t know what life will be like after ASI arrives. We’re creating something that could change nearly everything but we really do not know in what ways.

There are four main scenarios where things could go very wrong for us:

A self-improving, autonomous weapons system “breaks out”. Various groups will race to develop the first ASI and use it to gain advantage and control. An ASI itself will turn malicious and seek to destroy us. We don’t align the goals of the ASI with our own.

Now let’s look at each of these in turn and determine just which we should concern ourselves with the most.

1. A self-improving, autonomous weapons system “breaks out”.

“[Lethal autonomous robots] have been called the third revolution of warfare after gunpowder and nuclear weapons,” says Bonnie Docherty of Harvard Law School. “They would completely alter the way wars are fought in ways we probably can’t even imagine.” And that “killer robots could start an arms race and also obscure who is held responsible for war crimes.”

Militaries around the world are investing in robotics and autonomous weapon systems. There are good reasons for this that range from saving human lives (both soldiers and civilians) to greater efficiency. But what happens when an autonomous system with a goal to improve the efficiency with which it kills, reaches a point where it is no longer controllable. Unlike nuclear weapons, the difficulty and cost to acquire weaponized AI once it has been developed will be low and will allow terrorists and other rogue parties to purchase such technology on black markets. These actors won’t show the relative restraint of nation-states. This is a very real problem and we’ll see more news about this well before we get to a world with ASI.

2. Various groups will race to develop the first ASI and use it to gain advantage and control.

Similar to the arms race mentioned above, nations, companies, and others will be competing to develop the first ASI because they know that the first one that is developed has a good chance of suppressing all others and being the only ASI ever to exist. In the opening chapter of his book Life 3.0 Max Tegmark lays out how a company that manages to build an ASI manages to take control over the world. The Tale of the Omega Team is worth the price of the book, in and of itself. It lays out all the advantages the “first mover” to AGI and then ASI gains and all of the rewards that come along with that. It will be hard to convince everyone on Earth to leave that fruit on the tree. This is one of the reasons I believe the move from ANI to AGI/ASI to be inevitable. I hope (maybe naively) that it is some group with good intentions that wins this “last race”.

But these stories need not be relegated to the hypothetical. Russia and China area racing to develop ever more sophisticated systems as the West tries to create guardrails.

“ Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” —Vladimir Putin September 2017, in a live video message beamed to 16,000 Russian schools.

3. An ASI itself will turn malicious and seek to destroy us.

Unlike the scenarios above, this requires the AI to “want” to hurt humans of its own volition. Neither I, nor serious AI researchers are concerned with this scenario. AI won’t want to hurt us because they won’t want. They won’t have emotions and they won’t think like us. Anthropomorphizing² machines/programs in this way, is not useful, and could actually be quite dangerous.

It will be very tempting to look upon these programs — that may indeed mimic human speech, comprehension, and emotions — and believe they are like us, that they feel like us and are motivated as we are. Unless we specifically attempt to create this in them, artificial intelligences will not be made in this image.

4. We don’t align the goals of the ASI with our own.

This is the scenario most AI safety researchers* spend most of their time on. The concept of aligning the goals of artificial intelligences with our own is important for a number of reasons. As we’ve already defined, intelligence is simply the ability to accomplish complex goals. Turns out machines are very good at this. You could say that it is what we built them for. But as machines get more complex, so does the task of goal setting.

* Yes, AI Safety is a thing that organizations like The Future of Life Institute and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) spend a lot of time studying.

One could make a compelling argument (if you’re a biologist) that evolutionary biology really only has one primary goal for all life — to pass on genetic instructions to offspring via reproduction. Stated more crudely, our main goal as humans is to engage in sex and have babies. But as you may have noticed, even though we spend a fair bit of energy on the matter, that isn’t the thing we do all the time. We have developed sub goals like eating, finding shelter, and socializing that serve to help keep us alive long enough to get to the sexy times. Once we have kids, even though all we have to do is raise them until they, themselves are old enough to procreate, we still find other things with which to occupy ourselves. We go on hikes, surf, take photos, build with LEGOs, walk our dogs, go on trips, read books, and write blog posts — all of which don’t further our goal of passing on our genes.

We even do things to thwart our one job on planet Earth. Some of us use birth control or decide not to have children altogether. This flies in the face of our primary goal. Why do we do things like this? Let’s refer to Max Tegmark’s book Life 3.0 again:

Why do we sometimes choose to rebel against our genes and their replication goal? We rebel because by design, as agents of bounded rationality — we create/seek “rules of thumb”, we’re loyal only to our feelings. Although our brains evolved merely to help copy our genes, our brains couldn’t care less about this goal since we have no feelings related to genes… In summary, a living organism is an agent of bounded rationality that doesn’t pursue a single goal, but instead follows rules of thumb for what to pursue and avoid. Our human minds perceive these evolved rules of thumb as feelings, which usually (and often without us being aware of it) guide our decision making toward the ultimate goal of replication. [but] since our feelings implement merely rules of thumb that aren’t appropriate in all situations, human behavior strictly speaking doesn’t have a single well-defined goal at all.¹³

“The real risk with AGI isn’t malice but competence. A superintelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble.”

Every post about AI existential risk must mention the “paperclip parable”. Tap the paperclips for a game.

Every post about AI existential risk must mention Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom’s “paperclip parable”.¹⁴ Sorta like a restatement of the genie or Midas problems, or — restated — be careful what you wish for.

“But, say one day we create a super intelligence and we ask it to make as many paper clips as possible. Maybe we built it to run our paper-clip factory. If we were to think through what it would actually mean to configure the universe in a way that maximizes the number of paper clips that exist, you realize that such an AI would have incentives, instrumental reasons, to harm humans. Maybe it would want to get rid of humans, so we don’t switch it off, because then there would be fewer paper clips. Human bodies consist of a lot of atoms and they can be used to build more paper clips. If you plug into a super-intelligent machine with almost any goal you can imagine, most would be inconsistent with the survival and flourishing of the human civilization.”

— Nick Bostrom, Paperclip Maximizer at LessWrong

So what should we do about this? AI/Human goal alignment is likely to be a recurring theme here at AltText for a while so we will only touch on it now. Life 3.0 puts forth a pretty basic-sounding plan designed to make future AI safe, involving:

Making AI learn our goals Making AI adopt our goals Making AI retain our goals

Sounds simple enough but it is actually incredibly difficult to define and carry-out a plan like this. And we may only get one shot with it, since the first ASI is likely to be the only one to ever be created.

This goal-alignment problem will be the deciding factor of whether we become immortal or extinct when artificial super intelligence becomes a reality.",https://medium.com/alttext/artificial-intelligence-and-the-bleak-darkness-that-could-befall-us-451c4ffdee1b,Ben Edwards,2017-11-16 05:47:38.097000+00:00,"AI,Artificial Intelligence,Humanity,Future,Goals"
Identifying Outliers,"2. Using Moving Average Mean and Standard Deviation as the Boundary

Like in the first method, we need to get the boundary first and apply the boundary to the dataset. This time, a moving average mean and standard deviation (std) will be employed. To calculate the mean and std, a 21-day window is chosen, as that represents the average trading day in a month. You can choose any days, but the sensitivity will vary.

To get the mean and std, it is easy with one line of code in Pandas:

d1[['mean', 'std']] = d1['simple_rtn'].rolling(window=21) \

.agg(['mean', 'std'])

There are too many NaNs . The next step is to remove them:

d1.dropna(inplace=True)

Let’s draw a graph and find out where the boundary lays:

What happens if I use three times the std instead?

Hmm… a bit of an overshoot. Let’s change it to two times the std:

Bringing Colab to a Jupyter Notebook near you…,"Bringing Colab to a Jupyter Notebook near you…

Google has built some nice features in Colab. Now you can benefit from some of these in Jupyter Notebook.

It’s errors all the way down

When programming in Python, it can be quite overwhelming when you hit an error deep down in a stack of nested function calls. One of the advantages of Python is that it has an enormous amount of high quality libraries available and for which the source code is readily available. Sometimes, it is useful just to be able to dig in to it in order to be able to understand what is going on.

To help you do just this, Google Colab automatically displays clickable links to the source files in the stack trace, as well as a handy button that searches for the error in Stack Overflow. Wouldn’t it be nice if Jupyter Notebook could do the same? That’s what I thought, so I decided to create a Notebook Extension that does exactly that.

Goto Error Notebook extension

If you have not already installed Jupyter Notebook extensions, you can do this by typing

pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

Download the Goto Error code from GitHub with

git clone git://github.com/teticio/nbextension-gotoerror

install it like so

jupyter nbextension install nbextension-gotoerror

and finally, enable it thusly

jupyter nbextension enable nbextension-gotoerror/main

If all goes to plan, you should be able to configure the Goto Error extension in the nbextensions tab of Jupyter Notebook.

As the Jupyter server is only able to access files in the directory in which it is run or a subdirectory, for the notebook to be able to open the source files it is necessary to provide a soft link to the source file directory. For example, if you don’t use virtual environments, make soft link in the Jupyter launch directory to the site-packages directory of your Python installation (e.g. ~/lib/python3.6/site-packages ) and call this site-packages . Then set the prefix parameter in the nbextension configuration to ~/lib/python3.6 .

If you do use virtual environments, then point the soft link to the envs directory and set the prefix parameter accordingly.

To make a soft link in Linux:

ln -s ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages site-packages

To make a soft link in Windows:

mklink -d envs C:\users\teticio\Anaconda\python\envs

It should now work just like the following example.

You want more?

Google Colab has some other great features (apart from free access to GPUs and TPUs!). For example, if you add a #@param comment to the end of a line, it will automatically create a form which allows the user to input a value. For example

fred = 123 #@param {type : 'number'}

pops up a form with ‘fred’ and the number 123. If you change the number in the form to 456, say, the code is changed to

fred = 456 #@param {type : 'number'}

I’d like to develop an extension for Jupyter Notebook that does the same thing and, while I’m at it, port both of these extensions to Jupyter Lab.

"Subject, Consumer, or Citizen: Three Post-Covid Futures","Like all of us I suspect, I’m currently feeling a wild mix of emotions, from fear for the wellbeing of friends and loved ones, to anxiety about our work and the business we’ve built, to concern and indeed guilt when I think of the many people facing lockdown in situations far worse than mine; and alongside those immediate personal responses an intense collision of hope and fear for our collective future. This piece, really written with and by the whole team, is an initial attempt to draw on the thinking and work we at New Citizenship Project have done over the last five years to make sense, partly to ground our own work in this time, and partly with an ambition to offer something that can help the people we have worked with over the years to do the same. We would love to hear any thoughts, comments and ideas it provokes.

The Crucible

The great paradox of this moment is that our society is moving slower, yet at the same time changing faster and more fundamentally, than it has for decades. All of us are adapting, and this is just the beginning. This is still the time, first and foremost, to keep our businesses afloat, our children educated, and our relatives looked after. But in an only slightly broader view, this is also a time of tremendous and urgent importance. This moment is a crucible from which our society, economy and politics — and more importantly all of the organisations, large and small, that make those up — will emerge as different beasts.

At the New Citizenship Project, we have a particular way of seeing this challenge. Since 2015, we have been working from the understanding that in the broad historical moment of the early 21st century, we are entering the era of the Citizen: a time when people, dissatisfied with being mere Consumers, increasingly yearn for agency and control over what matters to them, and where authentic participation based on agency and purpose holds the key to a brighter future. These are ideas that have earned a platform and stimulated change at organisations from The Guardian to the Co-op to the European Central Bank.

Now, with Covid-19, the historical moment has ceased to be broad, and become immediate. In this context, our purpose here is to offer our underlying framework, in the hope it might be helpful in three ways:

as a lens to help make sense of what is happening;

of what is happening; as a way of framing the deep choice that we now face collectively; and

the deep choice that we now face collectively; and as an invitation to step into the agency we all have — even now — to shape the future.

The Citizen Shift

Five years ago, we published a report called This Is The #CitizenShift, laying out the core ideas that continue to underpin all our work.

Our argument was that there are broad historical moments when the dominant moral story of our society changes. At the start of the 20th century and for centuries before, we were Subjects: the right thing to do was to keep our heads down, do our duty and be content with our lot, while the God-given few led society forward. Through two world wars, this story collapsed. In the decades that followed, we became Consumers: the right thing to do was to look out for ourselves, to choose the best deal from those that were offered, to produce whatever people would consume, because if we did the best society would result.

Our report argued that, in the 21st century, we are now living through another moment of collapse and rebirth: a shift from Consumer to Citizen. Now, the right thing for us to do is to get involved, to step into our own power to shape the world for the better, and to open up opportunities to do so for others. The flaws of the Consumer story have been badly exposed by the financial crisis and the climate emergency, and the digital era has created new spaces for participation that we can use to replace it with the Citizen story.

Subject Consumer Citizen: Quickfire Concepts — from This Is The #CitizenShift

The urgency of Now

This understanding frames our mission at the New Citizenship Project: working with organisations of all shapes and sizes to help them build and inhabit the Citizen story. We support and challenge the organisations we work with to name and recognise Consumer logic in what they do, and to adopt new behaviours and structures which channel people’s ideas, energy and resources (to use the language of our friends at Lincolnshire Coop), not just sell them stuff.

As we have been doing this work, we have been thinking and learning about how the big societal change will happen: how the Citizen will move from an emergent possibility to become the new dominant story.

With Covid-19, two things have changed in our view.

First, this just got very real: the historical moment is no longer broad, but immediate.

Second, it has become clear that the step forward into the Citizen story cannot be taken for granted: the dominant story will be contested, and there is no guarantee this story will win.

This, then, is how we understand what is happening right now. We are living through a contest between these three deep stories. All three are present and alive in this moment. One will emerge as dominant, and which it is will dramatically shape our collective future.

Three possible futures

The Consumer story could be restored. This is what “back to normal” would mean. It would be a little like the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash. Some part of all of us wants this very badly: our commutes, our coffees, our crises put back where they were so we can “open back up” and pick up where we left off. And there will be powerful interests and an awful lot of money put into making this happen for us: a recent piece by Julio Vincent Gambuto brings this to life with a powerful prediction of the “ultimate gaslighting”, as billions of pounds are spent persuading us to pretend that nothing ever happened.

The Subject story is also making a very big comeback. We are already seeing not only the accentuation of already appalling levels of inequality, but also near-universal acceptance — even embrace — of radically reduced civil liberties. If there is a part of us that wants to go back to normal, there is another that is reassured by the idea that someone else is in charge. This is a story that has a clear path to develop, build and take over. There is significant potential for mass surveillance programmes to come into operation and be framed as essential to the lightening of lockdown, tracking people in order to track the virus. Hungary and Israel have already been described as the first “virus dictatorships”; it is all too plausible that others could follow.

The huge opportunity, though, is to make this the moment when we choose to step forward together into the Citizen story. We are already seeing the myriad ways that people, communities and organisations are reclaiming agency and finding purpose within the present moment, despite the restriction of individual freedoms. Mutual Aid groups and hyperlocal self-organising units have sprung up everywhere. Businesses and suppliers are coming together rather than simply competing. Some central government departments and more local authorities (though not all) are making interventions that seek to sustain, channel and develop agency, not just treat people as self-interested individuals to be policed or “nudged” into compliance. There is a part of us that is deeper and more fundamental, and has been more starved, that is nourished by this, a part we feel when we look across the fence, clap the NHS, and act for someone we do not know. This too could grow. This does not just have to be a nice side effect; it could be the beginning of the new story.

These are the three ways forward from here. To be brutally frank, two will simply result in continual and cascading failure, for organisations of all types and for humanity as a whole. If we return to the Consumer story, we will be back to square one on the challenges of climate and inequality (and more) that this story has arguably created, having eaten time we do not have. In short order, we will be back in crisis. The Subject story is even worse, restoring the standing challenges but with the addition of the kind of cover-ups and conspiracies that will hamper progress and slow change even more. In short order, we will be back in crisis. Both scenarios are seductive, because they’re familiar, but they won’t work.

The Citizen story is the only one that actually works. But it is the most difficult, because it is unfamiliar: we are still early on in the imagining and shaping of a Citizen society. The institutions and processes are not “off the peg”. We have work to do. All of us.

The agency we all have

There is of course much in this moment that sits in the hands of national governments, more than has been the case for decades. But to leave that statement to stand bare and unexamined is to walk the path to the Subject story, or at best the Consumer. The Citizen story by contrast adds two important qualifications: first, that government in a democracy is, in principle, government by Citizens — i.e. all of us are involved — not government of Citizens; and second, that the space for government is defined by wider society — the communities we live in, and the organisations we work for. With this understanding, we restore our agency, our power to shape the future, both individually and collectively.

In this view, indeed, the bigger truth is that no government can make the Citizen story happen for us. It will require communities across the country and the world, and organisations from across sectors to lead into new ways of thinking and operating — and it will require this to be driven by individuals who have the courage to think and act differently, learning more from their peers and fellow Citizens in other sectors than from the previously established norms of their own worlds.

This has to some extent always been the case, but it is so much more true in times of flux and uncertainty. Careers, reputations, and legacies will be made in the coming months, many of them apparently from nowhere. Organisations of all sectors will reorient dramatically. That is what it means for society to reshape. This is a huge moment of opportunity for us all, individually and collectively.

There are no answers yet as to exactly how to do this. As a starting point, then, here are three levels of questions we offer you to ask yourself, and that we are asking ourselves.

As an individual Citizen…

How can you find and build agency in your own life in this moment, even through small actions? How can you recognise in yourself when you are being treated as a Subject or a Consumer? How can you call this out when it happens? How can you recognise when you yourself act towards others as Citizens, creating opportunities for them to express their agency?

As a Citizen of a local community…

How can you find a level of connection to the place where you are that works for you? How can you make a contribution that you can sustain and that is right for you? How can you develop your understanding of where power lies locally — what councils and authorities are there? How are they operating and treating people locally? How can you help or perhaps challenge them to do it better?

As a Citizen of your organisation/employer…

How do you understand the purpose of your organisation? What is it really there in the world to do, and what could it be? How could your organisation operate differently in order to create more space for people to find their agency, and share in its purpose, not just transact? How could your organisation involve people more directly and actively? How could you start or build something in this moment, even something small, that could grow?

Ultimately, all these questions stem from one that is deeper and more fundamental:

What would you do in this time if you truly believed in yourself and in those around you?

This is happening

We want to close for now by saying that we see the people we have worked with over the years leaning into this already, and indeed we have got this far with our understanding by watching you.

We’re already inspired by Kirklees Council with their approach to partnering with and supporting community organisations rather than attempting to either replace or manage them (see Community Response Kirklees); the Guardian working with readers and communities through initiatives like Anywhere But Westminster to understand the true impact of the virus; the Co-op seeking to put its member participation platform in service of community support; and perhaps most of all by the University of Bath Students’ Union (The SU Bath) for the energy, commitment and all-round Citizenship -small and big ‘C’ - of their officers, staff and members (not least in their work with Bath and North East Somerset Third Sector Group, another organisation we hugely admire).

Over the last five years, we’ve built a business out of both celebrating and supporting organisations of all sectors to build the Citizen story. In the coming weeks, we’re going to be looking for more examples like this to celebrate, organisations reframing and reinventing their relationships with people to build and distribute agency, and talking to the people who are doing it; and if we can help you be part of it, we’re here.

This is a crucial time, a difficult time, and a dangerous time. But it is a time when the Citizen Shift is very much on the cards.",https://medium.com/new-citizenship-project/subject-consumer-or-citizen-three-post-covid-futures-8c3cc469a984,Jon Alexander,2020-04-17 10:03:23.148000+00:00,"Consumerism,Society,Future,Coronavirus,Agency"
The 5 Best Ways to Write More Articles,"1. Become an idea-machine

Generating ideas is a common struggle amongst writers. The blank page is the enemy, and they don’t know how to make its blood spill. This holds them back from writing.

How is it that even though ideas come from everywhere you’re not receiving them at all? There’s only one reason why: you don’t have an open mind.

Though not on purpose, you’re regularly consuming the same type of content, and therefore, thinking the same thoughts.

How are you supposed to write about new topics when new ideas aren’t entering your head?

To become an idea-machine, you need to be open to everything — even if it’s random and unrelating to your niche.

Even though you write about productivity, don’t read another book about that subject. If, while you were browsing online, a history book about Kennedy piqued your interest, read that. Rather than watching another class on writing, watch the interior design course you’ve been eyeing.

You’re not digging for ideas about history or interior design. You’re putting yourself in a position to get a thought that leads to another thought that turns into an idea that transforms into an entire article.

Even looking up from your phone and staring at the sky and the trees and the ocean lets ideas bubble in your brain until they explode on the page.

If you find nothing out in the world, look inside yourself. Ask yourself what you feel, how you feel, about your dreams and hopes and fears. That’s when you’ll discover various stories, memories, and lessons.

By consuming and doing different things you start having different thoughts.

If you have ideas, especially ones that excite you, you’re going to want to sit and write. Nothing will stop you then — not until you’ve told the whole story.",https://medium.com/the-brave-writer/the-5-best-ways-to-write-more-articles-29656cbfa21,Itxy Lopez,2020-08-26 16:19:54.633000+00:00,"Creativity,Writing Tips,5 Tips,Productivity,Writing"

Why It’s Important To Write About Your Unoriginal Ideas,"Context is everything

Why is it when someone gives a great speech, even if everyone in the audience agrees, very few take action?

Context is everything. When you read or listen to something, your context needs to be right for it to sink into your soul and take effect.

Let’s break down a person’s context.

Ability to understand

You don’t teach 5-year-olds about quantum mechanics. They don’t have the capacity to understand it. That doesn’t mean they never will. Their brains just aren’t there yet.

In the same way, just because something is true doesn’t mean everyone is able to understand and apply it. That’s why life advice from parents often goes over the child’s head. Their mentality isn’t there yet.

Timing

Based on what’s going on in your life, you react to things differently. Someone who just graduated college is more likely to absorb career advice than someone still in high school. Both are able to understand it, it’s just more applicable to the former.

That’s why you can hear the same thing for years but never take it in. Adele’s music only started speaking to me when I went through a breakup. It’s all timing.

How it’s presented

People react differently to the way information is presented.

Some people are heavy readers. Others are better listeners. Some people like to be pushed. Others like to be lovingly encouraged.

I used to be more of the ‘Jay Shetty’ kind of listener. I appreciated the calm, gentle advice he gave. But at some point, I realized it didn’t really push me to make changes. I agreed with everything but didn’t really internalize it.

Then I switched to Gary Vee. He had a more direct, no-nonsense, ‘kick up the backside’ approach which really got me out of my comfort bubble.

Delivery is also important. Nobody wants to listen to an arrogant, selfish know-it-all. You are more inclined to listen when someone talks with care, humility, and a genuine interest to help you.

We evolve

Your context affects how you receive information, but you also grow as a person. You won’t be the same person in 5 years. You shouldn’t be, anyway.

Life gives you challenges and victories that teach and define you.

You learn more.

Your circumstances change.

You meet new people.

You move on to the next stage in life

Your perspective changes.

So every encounter with knowledge should be looked at with new eyes.

I’ve read some of the same books again and again throughout my life and each time I read them I find something new. I’m able to make connections I didn’t make before. The beauty of timeless wisdom is each time you encounter it, your understanding deepens.

Even watching some of my favorite cartoons years later, I now spot the adult jokes that flew over my head as a kid. That’s why I don’t mind revisiting some of my favorite talks, articles, books, and movies. It’s not about excitement. It’s the added insight and appreciation I get each time.",https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/why-its-important-to-write-about-your-unoriginal-ideas-1004d55b7e28,Nathan Burriston,2020-08-20 03:23:40.492000+00:00,"Writing,Learning,Creativity,Education,Self-awareness"
Foxing’s ‘Nearer My God’ is the Best Song of 2018,"The Song

Putting the strengths of the album aside, its title track easily the best song I’ve heard in 2018, and one of my favorites of all time. This is the kind of song that I have to force myself to stop listening to, lest I get sick of it; the kind of song that I want to put on every playlist; the kind of song that reminds me why I love music. “Nearer My God” is hauntingly beautiful, and I’ll do my best to describe why in the next few paragraphs.

As best I can tell, the lyrics are a self-reflection on the band’s existence and their careers. Murphy opens the track by yelling “I want it all,” continuing, just a few lines later, with “Cause I’d sell my soul/To be America’s pool boy/The crown centerfold/My few good years left, a tribute/To anyone who wants me at all/Does anybody want me at all?/Oh, do you want me at all?” Set against a piercing backdrop of music that I can only describe as haunting, Murphy’s desperation and anxiety are almost palpable.

What must it feel like to dedicate one’s life to learning a craft (in this case music) only to question these decisions a few years in? What kind of anguish must rise out of years devoted writing and singing, followed by this kind of uncertainty? I’m not musically inclined, but I can only imagine that this feeling must be crippling. After hearing this song a few times, I admire the honestly and openness that led to its creation.

Lyrical brilliance aside, the specific ways that the music’s climactic moments fit with the lyrics is the final ingredient to this song. After Murphy asks “Do you want me at all?” multiple times, the background music swells into a piercing crescendo that divides the first half of the song from the second and is one of the most impressive musical moments I have ever experienced. When Murphy’s voice enters the track again a few measures later, the lyrics flip from wanting musical fame to poking holes in the very vision that he longed after moments before. “I’ve got it all,” he sings, sounding no happier than before.

At just a few minutes long, this song still feels emotionally exhausting. It’s clear that it took a tremendous amount of courage and work to put these lyrics and notes together, and the end result — when listened to closely — conveys these elements well. It may not be the most accessible song, or the easiest to listen to, but the value and beauty here can’t be missed.",https://medium.com/the-coastline-is-quiet/foxings-nearer-my-god-is-the-best-song-of-2018-11d03391af19,Thomas Jenkins,2018-12-03 19:27:32.333000+00:00,"Design,Writing,Songs,Music,Culture"
What Are The Benefits Of Cloud Data Warehousing?,"What Are The Benefits Of Cloud Data Warehousing?

And Should You Switch

Data warehousing was introduced in 1988 by IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy.

Since then the concept has evolved and taken on a life of its own. Increasing challenges and complexities of business have forced data warehousing to become a distinct discipline. Over the years this has led to best business practices, improved technologies, and hundreds of books being published on the topic.

Instead, this article will discuss the future of data warehousing and how it has been impacted by the cloud. Over the past decade, we have seen multiple new cloud data warehousing technologies pop up and be responsible for the largest software IPOs in history.

All because of a data warehouse.

A technology and discipline that is rarely even discussed in most computer science or IT degrees in college. Yet almost every large and medium organization has some form of the data warehouse.

It’s estimated by the year 2025 that the data warehouse market will near double from its current 18 billion USD market cap to 30 billion USD.

In this article, we will not only discuss why so many businesses are willing to invest in a data warehouse but we will also discuss how the cloud has improved data warehouses as well as leveled the playing field for businesses of all sizes.

My Nervous System Needs To Talk,"My Nervous System Needs To Talk

He Just Has To Get This Off My Chest

Photo by camilo jimenez on Unsplash

Hi, I’m Max’s nervous system. No this is not a Reader’s Digest parody. I just have to vent.

Sometimes Max does not work the way he should and that drives me nuts.

The other day, for example. You know he spends a lot of time alone writing things. You might think that would be stimulating to me, but have you seen some of the stuff he writes?

The point is, I don’t think he’s getting enough human interaction. So, when he does encounter someone, it can result in an embarrassing and frustrating experience. Take yesterday for instance.

We were going to the mailbox and happened to see a neighbor.

It could have been quick:

“How ya doin’?”

“I’m fine. How about you?”

“Doing well, thanks.”

That’s pleasant, efficient, and not embarrassing. But ol’ Max couldn’t leave it at that. He had to actually tells this guy how he was feeling.

“I’ve gotten out of my routine,” said Max. “I haven’t worked out for a couple of days and my back is letting me know.”

“Oh,” said the other guy, “You work out?”

For cryin’ out loud! This guy didn’t get the message that Max would answer his questions? Sometimes in great detail?

That was all Max needed. He was off and running. He’s like the person you ask for the time and they tell you how a watch is made.

I could tell Max’s mouth was moving and something was gushing out of it, but I didn’t care what it was. I just wanted it stopped.

I put in a 911 call to his brain.

“This call may be recorded for training purposes.

Max’s brain is engaged right now. Your call is important to us neurons and we will take your call in the order in which it was received.

Your estimated wait time can not be determined, because Max’s mouth is spewing stuff out like the mighty Niagara going over the falls.”

I wanted to hang on and listen to the hold music because it was that 80s one-hit-wonder “Hold On Eileen” by Dexy’s Midnight Runners. But I had to make him stop.

As a neuro system, I tend to be the physical type, but, still on hold to his brain, I decided to try something spiritual.

Perhaps an appeal to his empathy for the suffering of others would make him stop tormenting that poor man.

I called his soul.

No luck on the soul. He had spotted the trouble early and made his exit. When I found him, he was having an out of body experience and had got tangled up in the branches of a tree overhead.

I knew the soul was as troubled as me. He was shouting in tones no one could hear, “Max, shut up! Please stop talking!”

Meanwhile, Max’s tongue was still going like it was trying the beat his brains out from the inside. The fellow listening to this tirade had the look of an animal in a snare about to gnaw his foot off.

When Max gets going like that, he can become nonsensical. He’s not far from that on a good day.

I was still on hold with Max’s brain. My God, now it was playing “Rockstar” by Nickelback. Things were getting worse.

Nickelback. Back. Then I had it. His back. I have total control there. His back is his Achilles Heel.

It just took one sharp tweak. Max flinched and the listener was free.

Max’s spirit fell out of the tree and returned to its rightful place.

A customer service neuron came on the line from the brain.

“Thank you for holding. What is your emergency?”

“No emergency,” I said. “But could you play something soothing like Debussy?”

Max muttered a reproach to himself for neglecting his work out routine and we got the mail.",https://medium.com/the-haven/my-nervous-system-needs-to-talk-ac21341861ec,Max K. Erkiletian,2020-09-09 18:48:33.151000+00:00,"Humor,Neuroscience,Relationships,Brain,Psychology"
The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator — Timothy Winegard,"The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator — Timothy Winegard

A terrific subject and stirring information are tethered to a book that unfortunately loses credibility as you dig deeper

Microhistory is taking over the nonfiction market, and the newest addition, Timothy Winegard’s The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator is a perfect example of the intriguing subgenre. If you’re not familiar with “microhistory”, it is a relatively new trend that takes a specific subject and tracks it throughout (usually) the history of the world. Examples are Mark Kurlansky’s books Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World, Salt: A World History, and Milk!: A 10,000-Year Food Fracas. (If this subgenre interests you or you now realize, like me, that you love these kinds of books, take a look through Book Riot’s terrific list of 50 must-read microhistories.)

Timothy Winegard’s brand new The Mosquito is a great addition to the realm of microhistory in a couple of different ways. First, it’s surprising that this book has not already been written, considering the popularity of microhistory and the importance of mosquitoes in world history, as Winegard deftly explains in the book. Also, there is simply a great wealth of historical information in this book, all told through the lens of the mosquito but branching out in many surprising directions. I have not thought about mosquitoes the same way since reading this book, and that is part of the point. I don’t even remember Kurlansky’s Milk! affecting me in quite the same way. However (and this is a big “however” that I will deal with in detail below), I found several historical assertions or bits of information in The Mosquito that were either overstated or flat incorrect. This has really colored my perception of the book, and it has something I have been sifting through mentally for weeks now.

But first, the good. Winegard is a skilled writer that knows how to weave a good historical narrative. He also makes a great case for his main thesis, which is essentially that the mosquito, a tiny insect that can be swatted in an instant, might have had the greatest influence on world history of any non-human entity. Winegard states that some researchers have estimated mosquitoes are responsible for the death of almost half the humans that have ever lived. Even as diseases like malaria and yellow fever have either disappeared or been isolated to certain world regions, mosquitoes kill more humans per year than any other being, including other humans (if you, like Winegard, don’t count abortions, but I digress).

Winegard weaves the story of the mosquito through all* of world history, from speculation about whether mosquitos were responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs to modern attempts to eradicate mosquito-borne diseases. The breadth of time covered is outstanding, considering the speculative nature of the subject as you go further back in history. Winegard is not afraid to speculate and give an idea of where the scholarship is on a specific question, like what killed the dinosaurs or the positive effects of the marshes on Ancient Rome’s defensive capabilities. He even has a very interesting theory about how mosquitoes aided in the spread of Christianity because the religion “preached care for the sick as a recognized Christian duty.” This analysis of the mosquito from every angle and its effect on several major movements and developments in world history makes The Mosquito a very useful source for anyone interested in history.

*(“All” is more a reference to the time periods the book covers and not the regions of the world. The Mosquito is very focused on Western civilization to the detriment of almost any discussion of Africa or Asia. There is a 10-page chapter on the Mongols, but that’s it. I got excited when one page had an illustration of Japanese treatments for mosquito-borne diseases, but there was no mention of Japan on that page or anywhere else in the book. However, I am willing to give Winegard a slight pass on the Eurocentric nature of the book because I’m sure it is more difficult to work with non-Western sources of this nature and he is writing a mass-market history book, not an academic one. I would have just loved to see China, India, Japan, or any African country get a little bit of love.)

One specific positive of Winegard’s book is his writing style. He is able to tell stories well and injects humor often in order to make his points. One example sticks out to me, when writing about Herodotus’ narrative of Egyptian treatments for malaria:

(Herodotus) also reveals that the prevailing Egyptian practice for treating malarial fevers was to bathe in fresh human urine. Having never contracted malaria, I can only assume that its symptoms are so unbearably severe that a pampering soak in sparkling, steaming urine issuing from your thoughtful and upstanding servants is worth a shot for some well-deserved relief.

Not only can that excerpt be laugh-out-loud funny depending on your style of humor, but the words he uses are evocative and almost disturbing, which is a good thing when you are describing the horrific things Winegard relays in The Mosquito.

For all these reasons, I wanted to love The Mosquito. And part of me did. But I had some serious problems with multiple portions of Winegard’s historical examples and analyses. So here comes the negativity.

I was rolling along very happily in the book until I reached the chapter on mosquitoes and the development of Christianity. Winegard makes several great points, including one about how Constantine’s decree did not make Christianity the official religion but instead simply proclaimed religious toleration for Christianity. But then he makes statement that is simply and completely incorrect. He writes:

In 325, Constantine went one step further at the Council of Nicaea. To placate the adherents of the diverse and assorted polytheistic and Christian factions, and end religious purges, he blended their beliefs into one faith. Constantine ratified the Nicene Creed and the concept of the Holy Trinity, opening the doors for the compilation of the current Bible and modern Christian doctrine.

OK. This lights a fire under me specifically, but let’s look at it factually. This connection between Christianity and polytheistic factions in Europe is pointed out often, and no doubt some syncretism occurred in areas large and small. Christian practices incorporated polytheistic practices all over Europe, the most obvious of which is seen in Western Christmas traditions, but syncretism between Christianity and European polytheism did not ever reach the level of universal church doctrine. Councils like Nicaea were convened to ensure this. Both points Winegard makes here, about the Biblical canon and the Trinity, are listed under “Misconceptions” in the Council of Nicaea article on Wikipedia. (Yes, I know, Wikipedia is not a great source for research, but major articles are reliable and it is a good jumping off point for research. If Winegard had consulted Wikipedia at all instead of whatever sources he is spuriously using here, he would have seen sources to rebut his narrative and would not have made this mistake.)The Biblical canon had, essentially but not officially, been formed far before the Council of Nicaea, and the source of the misconception that it was formed at Nicaea is a pseudo-historical account by Voltaire. And, although the doctrine of the Trinity was formally put forward by Christians at least as early as the second century, it was not officially decided upon in the Catholic Church until after Nicaea and as far as we know the Trinity was not discussed at Nicaea. The focus instead was on the deity of Christ.

A mistake in one excerpt isn’t a huge deal. Then, in the aforementioned chapter on the Mongols, Winegard mentions that they had begun to conquer large swaths of eastern Europe and infers that mosquitoes were a major reason that the Mongols failed to conquer western Europe. He makes no allusion to the real reason they turned back: Ogedei Khan died, and there was a struggle for power, so Batu and his army abandoned the war in order to join the struggle to elect a successor back in the empire’s center. Could mosquito-borne diseases be a reason that they never returned? Possibly. But the lack of detail hurts the credibility of Winegard’s narrative.

Then I encountered a very problematic passage that made me rethink a lot of what Winegard has to say. In the chapter on the American Revolution, he makes this statement:

In December 1773, shortly after the ratification of the Tea Act, a strategic yet spiteful band of the Sons of Liberty disguised only in blankets and lampblack (not in the mythical Mohawk Indian regalia commonly portrayed) heaved 342 chests containing 90,000 pounds of tea into Boston Harbor during their Tea Party.

Wait, the colonists weren’t dressed as Mohawks like I’ve heard for my entire life? This is big news, so I looked for a source. None in the notes in the back of the book. Google is up next. Can’t find anything. I can literally find no source to back up Winegard’s American-history-altering statement. Usually you can find a source on the internet that says anything, you just have to weigh competing sources to find the most likely answer. Not in this case. It’s possible I can’t find whatever source he is referencing here, but everything I could find upholds the fact that some of the Sons of Liberty were wearing Indian garb. Not all of them, and not all in full native headdresses as commonly portrayed, but definitely in Indian dress. (Hey look, I’m actually including a link to my source to back up what I’m saying, and the source includes quotes from actual eyewitnesses to the event.) I welcome Winegard’s rebuttal and would love to see his sourcing, but this really bothered me.

After the Boston Tea Party sourcing fiasco, I went back to a couple other things that stood out to me earlier in the book, specifically a story about Alexander the Great’s death. Winegard explained the scholarship around Alexander’s death as coming around to the fact that he died of malaria (a mosquito-borne disease), but my little bit of research turned up that still no one is sure of the cause, and a new study suggests a completely new cause and a date of death six days later than previously thought.

So this series of issues bothers me for two major reasons: 1) Winegard shows a tendency toward the earth-shattering cynical view that disregards what years of scholarship portray. While this is sometimes healthy and something I even tend toward at times, it becomes dangerous when the breadth of research doesn’t support and you don’t give any source for what you are saying. That means no one can check your facts and they just have to take your word for it. 2) These major factual errors mean it is difficult to believe anything surprising that is said in the 400+ pages of this book. You have to do the work to double-check, as I did many times but not all the time, in order to know if a statement is true or if it is poorly-sourced.

I’ve been wrestling with what to do with The Mosquito for weeks now. I really do think a lot of it is beneficial to an understanding of world history, as Winegard makes very good arguments that the mosquito is much, much more important to an understanding of major conflicts and world historical developments than it is given credit for. However, I cannot overlook the factual errors and misrepresentations within the text. Someone who knows world history better than me could probably find even more, and as a mass-market history book I don’t think most people would see the errors and question some of them. We will probably have people running around saying that the Sons of Liberty didn’t wear Indian garb to the Boston Tea Party, and that is just not true. But they’ll think it is because they read it in a history book from a major publisher. I hope someone else writes this book or there is a second edition after it is read and revised by several historians. But in its current form, I won’t recommend it to my students and I can’t recommend it to you, reader, unless you want to do the work of checking everything that doesn’t seem right.

I’m always a take-the-meat-and-spit-out-the-bones person, but sometimes the danger of getting hurt by the bones of “alternative facts” outweighs the benefit of the meat.

Jafor became a cab driver in the early 2000s. He worked six-days per week — often 12-hour shifts, to give his family “the best opportunities they could possibly have.”

Heartbreakingly, Jafor’s wife passed away a few years ago from colon cancer, leaving him as a single parent to three children.

“He was someone who always put his family first,” Mahtab said. “He worked hard to make sure that his family back in Bangladesh, and here in America, were taken care of.”

He also believed in the power of education: Mahtab is a sophomore studying history and economics at Harvard University, while his younger sister goes to the Trinity School in New York City.

By early March, the Covid-19 outbreak began taking hold of the region. Jafor took precautions, such as wearing a mask inside his cab. Soon after, when his son came home from school around March 14th, he stopped driving and socially isolated with his children.

But a week later, he began to develop mild Covid-19 symptoms: a fever, cough and more. He eventually began experiencing extreme shortness of breath. On March 26th, his family called him an ambulance.

He was sent to Montefiore Medical Center, where he was put on a ventilator soon after his arrival. Since his condition accelerated so quickly, his family wasn’t able to speak to him. The doctors tried to save him with everything they could: hydroxychloroquine, and a few other medications. None of the treatments worked, and Jafor died on April 1st at the age of 56.

“It was a lot to take in,” Mahtab said. “It happened all of a sudden, and it was very unexpected. It’s like: ‘What happens from here? This wasn’t supposed to happen.’”

“My dad worked really hard for everything,” he added. “It’s sad… he won’t be able to see the fruits of his hard work through the paths of me, my brother and my sister.”",https://medium.com/wake-up-call/immigrant-harvard-dad-nyc-cab-driver-a-sons-tribute-to-a-father-lost-to-covid-19-274aa5e452dd,Katie Couric,2020-04-22 10:01:00.820000+00:00,"Victims,Health,Wellness,Coronavirus,Culture"
"Creativity Lies Behind Leisure, Not Working","Every human being has a unique creativity, though at different levels. This creativity emerges under the right conditions. We think that one of the most important of these conditions is financial opportunities and a comfortable life.

Yes, a person must have the time to allocate the things he has set up in his mind and the resources to allocate them if he has time. On the other hand, we know that people from different parts of the world, despite the limited opportunities at their disposal, create creative works within these opportunities. This would be sometimes a statue, sometimes a car prototype, sometimes a book.

Creativity, by its very nature, means this. Nobody has unlimited possibilities, only some have more, and these are undoubtedly more advantageous. However, revealing something from scratch is, from this point of view, using the available resources to produce something that has never created before.

If we have understood that each of us has a certain amount of opportunities in our hands, and it is possible to make something out of them, let us look at the second important key point to produce something. This is working, as we can all imagine.

It is not possible to produce something that does not exist, without spending a lot of time on it, without labor and thinking. The people we call creative are undoubtedly people who devote a lot of time to their work. But if you think working hard and constantly supporting what you want to do, you’re wrong.

The most important way to increase your creative ability is to create free time and engage in other things. Although this may seem contradictory, the more we evaluate the act of ‘creating’, the more easily we will understand why this is so.

First, we constantly learn something in the field we have focused on, trying to find out something, drown in details; this means that we should close ourselves to any new information that may come from outside within this time frame. Although it is very important to shut yourself out while you are concentrating on a task, the longer it takes, the more naturally the number of new things entering our brains decreases significantly.

Being creative means being as open to new things as possible. The greater and more diverse the number of information and data entering the brain, the greater the potential of the brain to recognize, process and produce something.

Besides, our experiences, what we see and meet outside, whether we are aware or not, add new things to us. The story outside feeds the story ‘inside’.

Second, our brains make a serious effort when working intensively or learning something. And like any muscle group, the brain needs rest to improve itself. You can’t go to the gym every day and train for hours, because the body doesn’t have time to provide the necessary nutrients and supplements, due to the work out the muscles . Similarly, each information entering the brain is a new neuron and the information set is a neuron network.

The brain needs free time to process, make sense of, and regulate these neurons in a healthy way. On the one hand, he can’t learn or do something intensely while thinking about something, because what he can do in a single moment is limited.

In other words, if you increase your mental capacity on the one hand and give your mind a free time to evaluate them on the other, it offers you new information and experiences in return for what you have not done before, or what can be put forward in the context of ‘creating’.

We’ve all experienced it. When an idea comes to mind, it is not when we think the most, but when we think the least or never think. Because in such a timeframe, our brain processes the data and information at its best without any pressure.

The important thing is to keep the balance between the time you spend to produce something and the time you can define as ‘leisure’, even if this time makes no sense to you.",https://medium.com/retinamagazine/creativity-lies-behind-leisure-not-working-6d373a6b0d10,Osman Soylu,2019-09-27 14:47:36.543000+00:00,"Health,Productivity,Life,Creativity,Work"
Thought Plagiarism and How It Threatens Creative Platforms,"Thought Plagiarism and How It Threatens Creative Platforms

When does copying end and the destruction of ideas begin?

Photo by Vinicius Amano on Unsplash

Every platform has its self-seekers — that is, those who try to game the system by milking the creativity of others and doing as little as possible on their end. Money and fame are usually the motivating factors for this.

They are the mimickers, the copiers, the type that ‘steal’ an idea and rework it in a way that rides on the coattails of the originator. They don’t care about attribution. They don’t wait and give the content distance in time. They’ll cash in as quickly and as frequently as possible. This is because to them, the internet is all about free speech.

Sometimes, they’ll go as far as calling it working smarter and not harder — except, the reality is that it’s leaning toward a black hat attempt to get as much money and attention as possible without adding value to the platform that’s paying them.

We’re not talking about those moments of mind-melding experiences where two creators happen to have the exact same idea or thought wave around the same time. It happens. Those moments are often done in isolation and innocence, making the similarities forgivable.

The difference between innocent creators and self-seekers is that the latter will exhibit an identifiable trend. They don’t just have one-offs — they have a history of content that seems too alike to be coincidental.

When enough people do this with money and fame as the main motivator, they drown out the original voices and contribute to the image of sameness on a platform.",https://medium.com/prototyping-a-year/when-people-chasing-after-money-and-fame-turn-platforms-into-trainwrecks-84018439878a,Aphinya Dechalert,2019-10-06 14:13:41.508000+00:00,"Social Media,Business,Creativity,Startup,Writing"
How I Deal With Negative Thoughts When I Have to Code,"How I Deal With Negative Thoughts When I Have to Code

How I stopped distractions from taking over and potentially ruining my career

Photo by Jefferson Santos on Unsplash.

“When there’s an elephant in the room, you can’t pretend it isn’t there and just discuss the ants.” — Ellen Wittlinger

This is my first ever article where I put the word “I” in evidence, as focus on readers is my main mission. But with the hard times we are all going through during this pandemic, I felt that giving a cookie-cutter solution to very personal problems wasn’t fair.

Today, I just want to draw attention to what has been my process over the last six months to dealing with negative emotions while I’m sitting in front of a computer trying to code.

Because you see, dealing with bad feelings and anxiety is different when you’re not working. You can find something to soothe you easily, like getting distracted by a movie or just laying down and letting your thoughts go.

But my boss doesn’t like that and doesn’t pay me to watch movies. They pay me to be productive, to make their problems my own for 40 hours a week. So I have to deal with that as a professional would.

Coding is not something that you can afford to do while being distracted. You must always have your next step in mind, thinking about a thousand different best practices to apply at the same time. It’s a very mind-egoistic practice because you can’t let your brain wander around anywhere else except the editor.

Here is a list of methods I used as my first-aid kit during these tough times.

How to Scale Python on Every Major Cloud Provider,"How to Scale Python on Every Major Cloud Provider

Best practices for cloud computing with Python

In the words of Pywren creator Eric Jonas, “The cloud is too damn hard!”

Python in the cloud.

Once you’ve developed a Python application on your laptop and want to scale it up in the cloud (perhaps with more data or more GPUs), the next steps are unclear, and unless you have an infrastructure team that’s already set it up for you, “Just use Kubernetes” is not so simple.

So you’ll choose one of AWS, GCP, and Azure and navigate over to the management console to sift through instance types, security groups, spot prices, availability zones, instance limits, and so on. Once you’ve got all of that sorted out and managed to rent some virtual machines, you’ve still got to figure out how to actually run your application on them. How exactly does my Python script divide up the work across a 10 machine cluster? At this point, you may try to rewrite your application using PySpark or mpi4py or Celery.

If that fails you’ll build a brand new distributed system like Uber and Lyft recently did with Fiber and Flyte. In either case, you’re either rewriting your application, building a new distributed system, or both. All to speed up your Python script in the cloud.

We’re going to walk through how to use Ray to launch clusters and scale Python on any of these cloud providers with just a few commands.

Here it is in a diagram. Step 1 is to develop your Python application. This usually happens on your laptop, but you can do it in the cloud if you prefer. Step 2 is to launch a cluster on your cloud provider of choice. Step 3 is to run your application wherever you want (your laptop or in the cloud).

Scale your Python application on any cloud provider with three steps. Step 1: develop your application locally (or in the cloud if you prefer). Step 2: launch a cluster on your cloud provider of choice. Step 3: run your application on the cluster!

Setup

First, install some Python dependencies.

pip install -U ray \

boto3 \

azure-cli \

azure-core \

google-api-python-client

Next, configure credentials for the cloud provider of your choice. You can skip this step if you’re already set up to use your cloud provider from the command line.

AWS: Configure your credentials in ~/.aws/credentials as described in the boto docs.

Configure your credentials in as described in the boto docs. Azure: Log in using az login , then configure your credentials with az account set -s <subscription_id> .

Log in using , then configure your credentials with . GCP: Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable as described in docs.

The Ray cluster launcher uses a config file that looks something like this

A minimal cluster config file for use with the Ray cluster launcher.

Here you can specify everything including setup commands to run, instance types to use, files to rsync, autoscaling strategies, and so on.

Fetch a slightly more complete example with additional configurable fields as follows.

# AWS

wget

# Azure

wget

# GCP

wget wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/robertnishihara/a9ce1d0d434cd52dd9b07eb57f4c3476/raw/dafd4c6bd26fe4599dc3c6b05e80789188b3e2e5/aws-config.yaml wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/robertnishihara/a9ce1d0d434cd52dd9b07eb57f4c3476/raw/dafd4c6bd26fe4599dc3c6b05e80789188b3e2e5/azure-config.yaml wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/robertnishihara/a9ce1d0d434cd52dd9b07eb57f4c3476/raw/1846cbf971d1cd708b3d29d9ae50ad882fbaac50/gcp-config.yaml

You’ll need to make a few minor modifications to the above config files:

Azure: Replace ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub with the appropriate key files.

Replace and with the appropriate key files. GCP: Set the appropriate project_id .

Step 1: Create a Python Application

Define a simple Python script that we want to scale up.

A simple Python application that can run on your laptop or in the cloud and tracks the IP addresses of the machines that its tasks are executed on. This script uses Ray to parallelize the computation.

You can run the example (actually a slightly more complete one) as follows.

# Fetch the example.

wget wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/robertnishihara/a9ce1d0d434cd52dd9b07eb57f4c3476/raw/4313660c0bd40f8bd909f70c1e0abc4be8584198/script.py # Run the script.

python script.py

You’ll see the following output.

This cluster consists of

1 nodes in total

16.0 CPU resources in total Tasks executed

10000 tasks on XXX.XXX.X.XXX

Now run the same script on a Ray cluster. These instructions are for AWS. To use Azure or GCP, simple replace aws-config.yaml with either azure-config.yaml or gcp-config.yaml in both lines.

Step 2: Start the Cluster

# AWS

ray up -y aws-config.yaml

# Azure

ray up -y azure-config.yaml

# GCP

ray up -y gcp-config.yaml

Step 3: Run the Script on the Cluster

# AWS

ray submit aws-config.yaml script.py

# Azure

ray submit azure-config.yaml script.py

# GCP

ray submit gcp-config.yaml script.py

You’ll see the following output.

This cluster consists of

3 nodes in total

6.0 CPU resources in total Tasks executed

3561 tasks on XXX.XXX.X.XXX

2685 tasks on XXX.XXX.X.XXX

3754 tasks on XXX.XXX.X.XXX

If it says there is only 1 node, then you may need to wait a little longer for the other nodes to start up.

In this case, the 10,000 tasks were run across three machines.

You can also connect to the cluster and poke around with one of the following commands.

# Connect to the cluster (via ssh). # AWS

ray attach aws-config.yaml

# Azure

ray attach azure-config.yaml

# GCP

ray attach gcp-config.yaml

Shutdown the Cluster

Don’t forget to shutdown your cluster when you’re done!

# AWS

ray down -y aws-config.yaml

# Azure

ray down -y azure-config.yaml

# GCP

ray down -y gcp-config.yaml

The Secret Behind Successful Performers — The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle,"Introduction: The Girl Who Did a Month’s Worth of Practice in Six Minutes

Coyle begins by introducing talent hotbeds, places that regularly produce top performers, then talking about a girl named Clarissa, studied by Australian music psychologists Gary McPherson and James Renwick, who watched her make “a month’s worth of progress in 6 minutes” when she actually buckled down and concentrated.

“Look at that!…She’s got a blueprint in her mind she’s constantly comparing herself to. She’s working in phrases, complete thoughts. She’s not ignoring errors, she’s hearing them, fixing them. She’s fitting small parts into the whole, drawing the lens in and out all the time, scaffolding herself to a higher level.” — McPherson, commenting on the Clarissa video.

Most of the time, though, Clarissa’s practice is about her not thinking, not learning, not building, and just wasting time.

Coyle says myelin is the “holy grail of acquiring skill,” which grows through practice.

PART 1 — DEEP PRACTICE

Chapter 1 The Sweet Spot

“For half of that time, being in a talent hotbed felt like standing amid a herd of running deer: everything moved faster and more fluently than in everyday life…But that was only half the time. During the other half I witnessed something very different: moments of slow, fitful struggle, rather like what I’d seen on the Clarissa video.”

Making progress: small failures, a shared facial expression of taut/intense squint.

When learners try a move, they fail, then stop and think, do it again more slowly, fail again, stops to think again, does it more slowly, break the move down to component parts.

Active retrieval versus passive reception of info makes you engrave things into memory.

Struggling at the edges of your ability makes you smarter. Experiences that force you to slow down, make errors, and correct them, make you “swift and graceful without your realizing it.”

Effortlessness is good for performance, not for learning.

The more we generate brain impulses through overcoming difficulties, the more scaffolding we build and the faster we learn. Turn mistakes into skills.

Henry Roediger, Wash U of St Louis: history students were split in 2 groups. 1st group studied 4x, second group studied 1x, tested 3x, 2nd group performed 50% better.

They’d studied one-fourth as much yet learned far more.

The more our brains generate impulses by overcoming difficulties, the more scaffolding they build, and the faster we learn.

Story: Edwin Link created the first pilot trainers by building sample planes.

How are Brazilian soccer players so good?

Players log 20 hrs a week of practice (as opposed to British 5 hours) and play futebol de salao (futsal), using a ball half the size and twice the weight of the real thing, that didn’t bounce, in a basketball-court sized concrete/wood/dirt field with teams of 5–6, not 11. It’s all about quick, nonstop, controlled action.

Why it works: Futsal players touch the ball 600% more often than soccer players, the smaller, heavier ball is harder to handle — you must be precise. It makes actual soccer easier.

Good advertising also uses these ideas to put viewers at the “sweet spot” of their abilities. For example, a whisky ad “ingle ells…ingle ells…the holidays aren’t the same without J&B”

Chapter 2 The Deep Practice Cell

Deep practice is a powerful idea because it seems magical. Clarissa begins as an average musician and, in six minutes, accomplishes a month’s worth of work.

The more you fire a circuit, the more that circuit is myelinated, and gets stronger and the more fluent your thoughts/mvts become. These circuits (NOT your muscles) control everything.

Automaticity: The more we develop these circuits, the more automatic our skills are, the less aware we’re using the circuits. The more we feel that a skill is natural, something we’ve always had.

We’re forever building vast, intricate circuits, and we’re simultaneously forgetting that we built them.

Myelin makes up more than half your brain’s mass.

Bill Greenough 1980s experiment showed that rats in an enriched environment had increased brain synapses by 25% and also white matter/myelin.

Greenough helped establish the concepts of brain plasticity and developmental windows.

Researchers started linking myelin deficiencies to dyslexia, autism, ADD, PTSD, etc.

Fredrik Ullen 2005: found a directly proportional relationship between hours of practice and white matter.

Myelin can regulate speed, and timing is imperative because neurons are binary, they either fire or not. If 2 neurons have to combine their impulses to make another one fire, they have to arrive at the exact same time.

Your brain has so many connections and possibilities that your genes can’t code the neurons to time things so precisely…But you can build myelin to do it. — Dr. Fields

Myelination is slow. It wraps 40–50 times, taking days to weeks per neuron. Fields: “It’s [myelinating thousands of nerves is] like insulating a transatlantic cable”

Struggle is not optional — it’s neurologically required

You have to fire the circuit suboptimally, make mistakes, pay attention, teach your circuit.

Deep practice is helped by a “primal state” where you’re attentive, hungry, focused, desperate.

Myelin wraps, doesn’t unwrap.

Myelin comes in waves, up into our 30s during critical periods, and we will gain myelin until 50, when you start to lose it, but even then 5% of oligodendrocytes stay ready to learn. That’s why most world-class experts start young.

In the 1970s, the cognitive revolution was starting. People believed that the mind works like a computer and obeys universal rules. In 1976, Anders Ericsson worked on a dissertation on verbal reports (people’s accounts of their mental states).

He caught the attention of Herbert Simon, Nobel Prize-winning economist who brought him to the US.

Every skill is a form of memory.

Deliberate practice: Work on technique, seek constant critical feedback, ruthlessly shore up weaknesses.

ALL skills are built with the same underlying mechanisms.

Michael Howe estimates that Mozart had studied 3,500 hours of music by age 6.

The rage to master: Ellen Winner’s term for people with an innate, obsessive desire to improve.

Chapter 3 The Brontes, the Z-Boys, and the Renaissance

Biographer Elizabeth Gaskell’s story of the Bronte sisters’ romantic creativity is not true. Rather, according to Juliet Barker, the Brontes lived in a home full of stimulating ideas, often imitated articles and books.

[The Brontes] wrote a great deal in a variety of forms — twenty-two little books averaging eighty pages each in one fifteen month period — and…their writing, while complicated and fantastical, wasn’t very good.

The Bronte’s early, unskilled writing is a prerequisite to their eventual literary success. They had to spend massive amounts of time being immature and imitative in the “safe space of their little books.”

They were practicing collaboratively.

To write a book, even a tiny one, is to play a particular kind of game.

Each one of the Bronte’s little books were terrible, except, each “made them happy, and each one quietly earned them a bit of skill.”

David Banks shows that geniuses tend to appear in clusters:

Athens, 440–380 BC

Florence, 1440–1490

London, 1570–1640

Why? People predicted: prosperity, peace, freedom, social mobility, new paradigms/perspectives.

But those predictions aren’t true.

Turns out, Florence saw geniuses emerge from the rise of craft guilds, based on the apprenticeship system, where young kids age 7 or so would live with a master for 5–10 years and learn.

If people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all. — Michelangelo

Monkeys have all the same neurons and neurotransmitters as us, but they have 20% less myelin, and they can’t talk beyond the level of a 3 year old.

This is also why breast fed babies have more IQ — there’s more myelin building blocks in breast milk.

Same with the reason why eating fish with fatty acids is good for preventing memory loss.

But building myelin is biologically expensive.

In the space of a generation, or a few hundred miles, certain higher skills flip from being crucial to being trivial and vice versa.

Our genes matter, but

We have a good deal of control over what skills we develop, and we each have more potential than we might ever presume to guess.

Chapter 4 The Three Rules of Deep Practice

HSE: the Holy Shit Effect. The feeling of seeing talent blooming in folks just like you.

Adriaan de Groot, Dutch psychologist, discovered that chess masters memorized boards via chunking.

Each group of chunks (discrete small circuits) nests inside other groups like Russian dolls. Reading is all about chunking at lightning speed.

Deep practice feels a bit like exploring a dark and unfamiliar room. You start slowly, you bump into furniture, stop, think, and start again.

Rules for myelination/learning:

Chunk it up: Look at the task as a whole (Spend time staring at/listening to the task in its totality, as a single coherent entity, listen to the song you want to play over and over. Absorb the picture of the skill, imagine yourself doing it) We’re pre-wired to imitate. Then break it into its smallest chunks. Then play it slow, then speed it up (to learn inner architecture) Slow it down Repeat it Learn to feel it: to avoid mistakes, you have to feel them immediately

Ray LaMontagne taught himself to be a singer-songwriter at age 22 by buying dozens of used albums by people like Etta James, Ray Charles, Al Green, Stephen Stills, and spending 2 years singing along to the records, ignoring everyone else. 8 years later, his first album sold nearly half a million copies.

Imitatsiya: Spartak (Larisa Preobrazhenskaya’s Russian tennis training center) term for rallying in slow motion with an imaginary ball. Students work on slow, simple, precise motions with an emphasis on technique. No one is allowed to play a tournament for the first 3 years.

If you begin playing without technique, it is big mistake. Big, big mistake! — Preobrazhenskaya

Ivan Galamian chose upstate NY to create Meadowmount music academy. In 7 weeks, students learn a years’ worth of material, 5x as much as anyone else.

The teachers cut music into strips, stuff it in envelopes, and pull chunks out randomly.

They cut the strips into smaller fragments by changing the rhythms. The goal? Break a skill into component pieces/circuits, memorize those pieces individually, link them into progressively larger groups (interconnect circuits)

One teacher’s rule of thumb: If a passerby can recognize the song being played, you’re not practicing right. Go 3–5x slower than ever. If you do this for 3 hours with one page of music, you can accomplish 1–2 weeks’ worth of shallow practice.

Going slow lets you pay more attention to errors and get more precise with your neuronal firing, which is everything.

It’s not how fast you can do it. It’s how slow you can do it correctly. — Tom Martinez, football coach

Barry Zimmerman studies how people coach themselves, self-regulation. (How they observe, judge, strategize, set goals, plan, self-monitor, adapt)

Experts think in terms of chunks, building up into a private skill language.

“When I click in, every note is being played for a purpose. It feels like I’m building a house…I connect them and get a foundation. Then I add the walls, connect those. then the roof, then the paint. Then, hopefully, it all hangs together.” — John Henry Crawford, Meadowmount student

There isn’t a substitute for attentive repetition. Action. Not talking, thinking, imagining, or reading.

To start losing skill, stop practicing for 30 days. Myelin will break down.

If I skip practice for one day, I notice. If I skip practice for two days, my wife notices. If I skip for three days, the world notices. — Vladimir Horowitz

There’s a universal limit to how much deep practice people can do in a day. 3–5 hours max, for all skills.

At Meadowmount, Skye Carmen taught students:

Athletes don’t fool around when they practice. Musicians are athletes too. Tune your instrument, then tune your ear. You have to feel mistakes coming. Hearing a string out of tune should bother you a LOT.

The deep practice cycle:

Pick Target Reach for Target Evaluate Gap between Target and Reach Repeat

Babies learning to walk stagger around: To get good, it’s helpful to be willing, even enthusiastic, about being bad.

Baby steps are the royal road to skill.

W Timothy Gallwey taught beginner students without speech: He just showed them how to hit.

I am slow to learn and slow to forget what I have learned — Abraham Lincoln

How To Create a Dynamic AWS ECS Cluster With Terraform,"0. Networking

The definition of the actual ECS cluster does not have any networking requirements.

resource ""aws_ecs_cluster"" ""cluster"" {

name = ""${var.environment}-cluster""

tags = var.tags

}

This is because the networking features are defined at the service level as these are the elastic components that host the tasks.

ECS overview

Our network requirements are specified in the service definition:

resource ""aws_ecs_service"" ""fargate-microservices"" {

for_each = var.create_microservices == true ? var.fargate_microservices : {}

name = each.value[""name""]

cluster = aws_ecs_cluster.cluster.id

desired_count = each.value[""desired_count""]

launch_type = each.value[""launch_type""]

depends_on = [aws_ecs_cluster.cluster,

aws_ecs_task_definition.ecs_tasks]

task_definition = each.value[""task_definition""]



network_configuration {

subnets = var.ecs_service_subnets

security_groups = [aws_security_group.ecs_security_groups[each.value[""security_group_mapping""]].id]

}



lifecycle {

ignore_changes = [

task_definition

]

}

}

There’s a lot to unpack here, I’m going to start by focusing on the network configuration.

network_configuration {

subnets = var.ecs_service_subnets

security_groups = [aws_security_group.ecs_security_groups[each.value[""security_group_mapping""]].id]

}

In this instance, the (private) subnets are inherited from a module which defines our VPC, when creating the dynamic cluster we simply reference our list of subnets in the VPC module in order to build the services into our desired VPC.

The security groups make use of the ‘for_each’ function in Terraform that underpins a lot of the mechanics of this module.

This functionality allows us to build out multiple resources that share the same arguments. The module simply requires for_each to be defined within the resource and then a ‘map’ variable to be passed into the specified argument.

for_each = var.create_microservices == true ? var.fargate_microservices : {}

In this case, we’ve specified that create_microservices must be true in order to create our services. Then the fargate_microservices variable is a map that contains all arguments required for our service (an example can be found in the ‘dynamic services’ chapter).

Now that we understand the for_each loop, here is the code within the module which allows you to define an arbitrary amount of security groups.

resource ""aws_security_group"" ""ecs_security_groups"" {

vpc_id = var.vpc_id



for_each = var.security_groups

name = ""${var.environment}-${each.value[""ingress_port""]}""



ingress {

from_port = each.value[""ingress_port""]

to_port = each.value[""ingress_port""]

protocol = each.value[""ingress_protocol""]

cidr_blocks = each.value[""ingress_cidr_blocks""]

}



egress {

from_port = each.value[""egress_port""]

to_port = each.value[""egress_port""]

protocol = each.value[""egress_protocol""]

cidr_blocks = each.value[""egress_cidr_blocks""]

}



tags = var.tags

}

This resource block will iterate over your ‘var.security_groups’ object which is defined outside of the module and will pick up a variable for each variable that is prefixed with ‘each.value’.

This is how you define a single security group outside of the module:

""ecs_security_groups"": {

""prod-ecs-sg"": {

""ingress_port"": ""redacted"",

""ingress_protocol"": ""redacted"",

""ingress_cidr_blocks"": [

""redacted""

],

""egress_port"": ""redacted"",

""egress_protocol"": ""redacted"",

""egress_cidr_blocks"": [

""redacted""

]

}

}

These are then mapped to their respective services using the ‘security_group_mapping’ variable inside the service, the variable matches the id of this security group (prod-ecs-sg) to the specified service. From here it is simple to add another security group by appending this map object.

Now we’ll revisit the service definition to see how the security_group_mapping variable is used in conjunction with the other dynamic variables.",https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-create-a-dynamic-ecs-cluster-with-terraform-86d6b11d0db9,Liam Hartley,2020-12-06 19:37:56.238000+00:00,"Terraform,Software Engineering,AWS,Software Development,Cloud Computing"
A.I. Needs New Clichés,"They thought we’d be there in 1978. Forty years later, we are there.

Or there’s this vision. Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) moves through a rose-tinted world in the movie Her. By day, he works for a company that writes letters for people who can’t emotionally muster it — himself an A.I. for people’s emotional worlds. He is dating Samantha, his intelligent operating system. Theodore moves through an urban world, having deeply connected conversations with Samantha yet remaining disconnected from the people around him. He is attuned to a voice that only he can hear, but who can be the same voice for thousands of others at the same time. Is he affected by the strange virtuality of his love, or avoiding the difficulties of relating to a real person, or both? The movie world of Her is color-corrected like gauzy Instagram photos of Coachella fans, an interface of image in which nothing is not a computer.

How do you communicate what you don’t understand?

The problem is that it’s hard to communicate clearly about A.I. — in part because communicating about it means understanding it. And most of us don’t have a clear understanding of what A.I. actually is. The term “artificial intelligence” has been around since 1955, when A.I. pioneer John McCarthy wrote that A.I. was a matter of “making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by man.” That idea hasn’t changed much today — Wikipedia contrasts artificial intelligence (or machine intelligence) with the natural intelligence of humans and animals, and the Oxford English Dictionary defines it as “the capacity of computers or other machines to exhibit or simulate intelligent behaviour; the field of study concerned with this. Abbreviated A.I.” But what does that actually mean to an everyday person? Does it mean chatbots passing a Turing Test? A robot uprising? Or is it simply interactivity where the processing happens just out of sight?

A.I. is a black box, “a device which performs intricate functions but whose internal mechanism may not readily be inspected or understood” (OED)—something we understand because of the inputs and the outputs. We can’t see what happens inside and we’re not meant to have access to it. The black box is opaque.

Today, there are three reasons for algorithmic opacity, as Jenna Burrell writes: the need to protect algorithms that are state or corporate secrets; the fact that A.I.-related coding is still the territory of specialists; and a “mismatch” between the mathematical ways algorithms process information and the way humans think. This last one is the hardest to sort out: how humans think is different than how the machine thinks, and how we reason is different than how the machine reasons (or doesn’t reason, depending on your definition of “reason”).

The European Union is requiring that A.I. be made explainable through a “right to explanation” as part of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) that just took effect. EU citizens have a right to an explanation for the work of algorithms, and they have a right to request human intervention. The regulations support the idea that “people are owed agency and understanding when they’re faced by machine-made decisions,” Cliff Kuang wrote in the New York Times. David Weinberger argues that rather than explaining itself, one focus of A.I. should be optimization, not explanation: make visible and clear to all through debate in public policy what trade-offs are being made, rather than potentially hobbling A.I.

The US government has never been known for well-designed PowerPoint decks

In the meantime, DARPA has introduced the Explainable Artificial Intelligence program, which seeks to make the models behind machine learning and A.I. more explainable. It’s an important move toward understanding what we mean when we talk about A.I., and yet I wonder what it will actually achieve for everyday people. The DARPA page for the project serves up this image showing what a user might be asking, but not in any quick way that’s going affect how it shows up in the world. Perhaps not surprisingly, DARPA returns to the same clichés as the Google Image Searches I mentioned above.",https://medium.com/s/story/ai-needs-new-clich%C3%A9s-ed0d6adb8cbb,Molly Wright Steenson,2018-06-13 23:20:09.138000+00:00,"Cliches,AI,Design,Artificial Intelligence"
There is Plastic in Your Fruits & Vegetables,"Microplastic Pollutes the Fruits and Vegetables We Eat

For the first time, microplastic was detected in fruits and vegetables by the scientist Margherita Ferrante and her team from the University of Catania in Italy. The existence of microplastic is evident in lettuce, carrots, broccoli, potatoes, apples, and pears.

The researchers found plastic participles are more concentrated in fruits than in vegetables. Fruits contain more microplastic due to their greater size and the age of the tree. Microplastic accumulates during the life of the tree. Another reason is the bigger root system of fruit trees compared to vegetables.

Apples show the highest amount of pollution for fruits and carrots for vegetables. The number of microplastic found in fruits and vegetables is still lower than in water from a plastic bottle.

A second peer-reviewed study, a joint project between the Leiden University in the Netherlands and the Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research in China, shows plastic is sucked up by the roots of food crops. Professor Peijnenburg from Leiden University explains that the roots of lettuce and wheat absorb plastic and transport it to the edible part of the plant.

Until now researchers didn’t believe that plastic can pass through the intact barriers of plant tissue. These findings raise serious concerns about the safety of the food we eat.

“For years we have known about plastic in crustaceans and fish, but this is the first time we have known about plastic getting into vegetables. “If it is getting into vegetables, it is getting into everything that eats vegetables as well which means it is in our meat and dairy as well. — Maria Westerbos, Founder of Plastic Soup Foundation

Traditional Media is Dead. Long Live Traditional Media.,"Facebook’s Q2 2016 earning sent the stock soaring to new heights. With the stock up 30% year over year, it’s clear that this mobile advertising juggernaut is transforming the ad industry. At BBDO, we have embraced the rise of Facebook by launching Project Thumb Breaker — an initiative that is fueling BBDO’s ambition to become the most effective creator of Facebook ads in the world.

While Facebook has transformed the ad industry, legacy brands have been disrupted by upstarts. The direct-to-consumer model combined with excellent customer service and smart branding has enabled Casper, Harry’s and many others to generate billions of dollars in revenue in less than a few years. Unilever’s acquisition of Dollar Shave Club demonstrates how disruptive this model can be… Unilever clearly intends to challenge P&G’s dominant brand Gillette.

Facebook advertising is a strong driver for brand growth. However, it’s a channel that works best as part of a broader ecosystem. Research has proven that integrated campaigns that leverage a range of channels drive stronger business results.

It’s clear that Harry’s and Casper have embraced the value of integrated campaign development — they don’t rely on Facebook, Google or any one individual channel. I ride the New York subway to work everyday. More and more, the OOH subway ads I see are from startup brands like Talkspace, Casper and Harry’s. And you know what… the ads work. If I am stressed out from a long challenging week, the Talkspace ad telling me that their app can pair me with a therapist instantly for $32/week is pretty effective. If I am tired and don’t really want to cook or go out, the Seamless ad makes me far more likely to order in. If I just moved or am not sleeping well, the Casper ad definitely encourages me to buy a new mattress. And if I am on the way to work after just getting ready, the Harry’s ad definitely makes me feel that Harry’s great design and style could make the start to my day just a little bit smoother.

Brilliant OOH ad from Talkspace. Note the social norming strategy that makes the app look popular and effective.

So, we should listen when Time Warner says that 95% of video consumption happens on TV and that Facebook video on its own would rank as the #158th most watched show. And we should listen when Facebook says it has 1.03B daily active mobile users. No individual media channel can become the golden bullet for a campaign. Marketers who want to create the most effective work need to leverage communications planning to integrate all of their advertising across all channels. Strong communications planning generates a multiplier effect on the impact of advertising.

Empower a Lightweight Python Data Structure: From Tuples to Namedtuples,"Tuple

When it comes to dealing with related data elements, one of the most commonly used data types is the tuple. As an immutable data type, tuples are sequences of data with a fixed size. They’re useful to group related data with different data types. Consider the following trivial example.

>>> employee0 = ('John Smith', 45, 'M', 160083)

In the above code snippet, we define a tuple called employee0 , which stores an employee’s personal data, including name, age, gender, and employee ID number. If we need to use some elements of the tuple, we can unpack it or use subscript, and their usages are shown below.

>>> # Use unpacking

>>> name, age, gender, employee_id = employee0

>>> print(f""Employee Name: {name}"")

Employee Name: John Smith

>>>

>>> # Use subscript

>>> print(f""Employee Age: {employee0[1]}"")

Employee Age: 45

>>> print(f""Employee ID #: {employee0[-1]}"")

Employee ID #: 160083

How about we need to deal with another employee in the same module? We’ll have to do something like below.

>>> # Create a tuple for storing another employee data

>>> employee1 = ('Jennifer Brown', 38, 'F', 150384)

>>>

>>> # Access data

>>> name1, age1, gender1, employee_id1 = employee1

>>> print(f""Employee Name: {employee1[0]}"")

Employee Name: Jennifer Brown

>>> print(f""Employee Age: {age1}"")

Employee Age: 38

>>> print(f""Employee ID #: {employee_id1}"")

Employee ID #: 150384

In essence, we have to repeat the above steps, and access individual elements using either unpacking or subscripts, which certainly is not the most pleasant thing to do. Actually, it can be error-prone because you have to remember the exact order of these data.",https://medium.com/swlh/empower-a-lightweight-python-data-structure-from-tuples-to-namedtuples-ca4abddd8ef6,Yong Cui,2020-05-02 11:01:01.048000+00:00,"Programming,Software Engineering,Artificial Intelligence,Python,Technology"
How to Age Effectively — Tips for Longevity,"How do you approach aging? Do you greet each birthday with a smile? Are you afraid of becoming a senior citizen? Maybe you don’t think about it at all. Old age is a long way off.

No matter how old you are, it’s never too early to start preparing for your future. In this article, we’ll review some simple ways to keep you healthy as you age. We’ll also discover that you don’t need to be afraid of getting older. In many ways, the best is yet to come.

How Smiling Can Keep You Alive

We’re going to start with an easy one.

A genuine smile can light up the room. It can also help you stay healthy in old age.

In Better With Age, Alan Castel discusses a study where researchers reviewed old baseball cards. They then divided the players into three categories:

The researchers then went back to see how long each of the players lived. The men who had no smiles lived to be an average of 72 years old. The half smilers made it to 75. The players with full, genuine smiles lived to be 80.

Of course, smiling might not cause a longer life, but expressing happiness and having a positive attitude are correlated with longevity.

How Physical Exercise Trains Your Body and Your Mind

There are few activities more important than physical exercise. Getting the blood flowing can help prevent a wide range of diseases, keep you at a healthy weight, and reduce stress.

Starting at around 50 years old, a part of the brain called the hippocampus starts to shrink. The hippocampus’s main job is to help with memory formation. A declining hippocampus is also associated with declining executive function and depression.

Walking just three times a day can help prevent mental decline. For bonus points, walk with someone else and make it social!

In one study, one group of elderly adults was assigned to walk 40 minutes, three days a week. After one year, their hippocampi grew by 2%. Both control groups (one assigned to stretching and one assigned to non-activity) each had hippocampi that shrunk by 1%.

It appears that cardiovascular exercise can help stop or even reverse age-related mental decline.

In The Brain That Changes Itself, Norman Doidge explains how physical exercise can help jumpstart neurogenesis-the creation of new neurons. The brain’s ability to adapt to new situations- neuroplasticity -is also linked with cardiovascular exercise.

You don’t have to be running marathons to get the benefits. As seen in the study above, even a walk outside can make a big difference.

If You Want to Stay Sharp, Never Stop Learning

When we grow up, we’re faced with new situations all the time. New material in school. Evolving social structures. Learning the ropes when we start our careers.

However, if you’re not careful, you can get complacent. While it can be comfortable to coast once you’ve settled into life, it’s not good for your health.

In The Brain That Changes Itself, Doidge explains that while physical exercise creates neurons, learning something new helps those neurons last longer. In addition, lifelong learning is associated with lower rates of dementia.

To keep the brain sharp, you can:

Read about unfamiliar topics

Learn to play an instrument

Learn a new language

Memorize poems

Learn to dance

A dance class offers a learning opportunity, exercise, and social interaction. The trifecta!

Mix it up and become a student of life. Getting outside your comfort zone keeps your brain on its toes and encourages increased neuroplasticity.

Try switching up your habits. Brush your teeth with your non-dominant hand. For bonus points, brush your teeth on one leg! Then you’ll be training your body and mind at the same time.

Learning new things can also expose you to other people, which is another great way to keep yourself healthy as you age.

Social Relationships Are Critical to Healthy Aging

Communicating with friends and family can work wonders. In Better With Age, Alan Castel explains that older adults with a social life tend to outlive those who are more isolated. Plus, staying social is associated with lower dementia rates and higher immune system function.

Staying connected can also help keep older adults happy. In one study, social interaction helped prevent depression in older adults. However, only face-to-face interactions really worked. Talking on the phone had modest effects. Texts and emails didn’t help at all.

Staying social is especially important after retirement. Older adults should make an effort and get out into the world. Human interaction is key.

The best activities combine social activity with physical exercise and learning something new. A dance class is an excellent example of an activity that checks all three boxes. Maximum brain protection.

Relax. It’s All Going to Work out.

Relax. You have a lot to look forward to.

While getting older might seem scary, there are many benefits. Studies have shown that older adults are consistently happier than those in middle age. While younger adults tend to focus more on negative information and material goals, the elderly focus on positivity and social goals. It’ll get better!

With age comes wisdom. Older adults tend to be more effective at controlling their emotions, not jumping to conclusions, and learning from their mistakes.

In any case, worrying about the future won’t make it any better. Acceptance of one’s circumstances is a reliable marker of life satisfaction as we age.

In fact, in Better With Age, Castel explains how having a negative outlook on aging is associated with higher rates of dementia and cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, staying positive and feeling younger is associated with a healthier lifestyle as an older adult. Just take a deep breath. You’ll be fine.

We should be thankful for what we have and stay present in the moment. We don’t need to fear old age.

“I am an old man, and I have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened” — Mark Twain

Perhaps the best course of action is to accept your circumstances while also preparing for the future. Be sure to get physical exercise, keep learning, and strengthen your relationships.

It gives you the ability to create something that you can be proud of. This means you can finally combine your love of programming with your love of cold hard cash.

Technology is only becoming more and more a part of everyday life.

And the best part about all this is that the sweet thing we call the World Wide Web has opened up new possibilities for programmers to find work. You don’t have to go into the office anymore to find programming work.

“If you want to succeed, double your failure rate.” IBM’s founder, Thomas Watson,

1 . Freelancing

Freelancing, Not just for those who don’t want to get a job anymore. Freelancing is a great way of making some side income while still holding down your day job. The gig economy has seriously changed the game for lots of skilled workers, including you and your genius programming brain. Just offer your programming services to clients online.

Platforms like Upwork or Fiverr seem to offer a lot of opportunities especially for doing things on the sidelines but be aware of the competition over there.

Take advantage of and leverage Facebook groups. There are dozens of Facebook groups that are designed specifically for freelancers. Programming-based groups are other places that teem with opportunities for freelance work. Facebook groups also allow you to showcase your work and garner support, make friends, and expand your network and connections. Below is a list of groups to get you started in your pursuit of finding that extra dollar.

A better strategy would be to work on your LinkedIn profile, contact recruiters and past clients from your network, go to conferences and meetups, and look out for platforms that match up remote workers with companies.

2. Start to Write

Writing still is one of the best ways to reach a broad audience. There are plenty of opportunities for you to start writing and make money out of it:

You can start your own blog and monetize with ad revenue.

and monetize with ad revenue. You can write books or ebooks and sell them online.

If you enter a market which has the opportunity with a product/service which can cater to a need, the chances are you will build a business out of it. There are challenges, creating awareness, capturing customers, getting them hooked to your product, or just getting people to adopt the product/service. This can be gained via building a technology leadership or building a barrier to entry. You have to be careful of competition, cause competition will come.

The firms which try and capture the first mover advantage will always have to be vary of competition to enter the market and beat them to building a sustained-viable business. The fight to being the ‘First Mover Champion’ is real and scary.

Not only that, the second mover advantage in the truest sense is capturing the majority of the market after the first mover has created it.

Rarely do first movers create a monopoly, cause there will always be an entrant who will follow them closely but never try and overtake the first mover. That is a second mover. A copy business or service or product. A firm which will learn from the mistakes of the first mover, and replicate all the successful strategies and add it’s own strategies to it. The second mover gains market share by utilizing the disadvantages of the first mover.

Simplifying Covid-19 Into One Mechanism: The Epithelial-endothelial Crosstalk,"The Epithelial-Endothelial Crosstalk

In a May research letter to Intensive Care Medicine, Amit Jain and D. John Doyle, professors of anesthesiology at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, proposed the “epithelial–endothelial crosstalk” hypothesis. And thorough autopsy findings later confirms it.

Epithelial cells refer to the lining or membrane that covers a specific tissue, such as alveoli (i.e., air sacs). In contrast, endothelial cells are a specialized type of epithelial cell that covers blood vessels.

In this crosstalk, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 first binds to the ACE2 receptor present on alveolar epithelial cells. Following virus replication inside alveolar sacs, the membrane breaks to release new virions that infect the pulmonary capillaries (i.e., small blood vessels surrounding the air sacs) via the ACE2 receptor. As virus replication continues, SARS-CoV-2 then latches on the ACE2 receptor on the pulmonary endothelium (i.e., cells lining the pulmonary veins or arteries, which are large blood vessels).

In sum, SARS-CoV-2 infects the air sacs (or alveoli). Then it goes to the small blood vessels (capillaries or capillary beds) surrounding the air sacs and subsequently to large blood vessels (pulmonary arteries or veins). Bracketed terms are illustrated:

As the professors explained: “Following alveolar-capillary membrane disruption, SARS-CoV-2 enters the pulmonary capillaries and directly infects the pulmonary endothelial cells via ACE-2 protein on the luminal surfaces.”

In a one-liner, SARS-CoV-2 goes from the alveolar epithelial cells to pulmonary endothelial cells — the “epithelial-endothelial crosstalk”.

“As a result, endothelial cells assume a ‘pro-inflammatory’/‘procoagulant’ phenotype,” Professors Jain and Doyle continued. “This accelerates Fas-induced apoptosis of alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells and orchestrates the cytokine storm and the progression of COVID-19 to ARDS.”

From hereon, as blood vessels connect all organs, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to damage multiple organs, as the autopsies have shown.",https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/simplifying-covid-19-into-one-mechanism-the-epithelial-endothelial-crosstalk-1d250dbd3083,Shin Jie Yong,2020-07-09 03:00:44.509000+00:00,"Innovation,Health,Coronavirus,Life,Science"
Streaming Data from the Universe with Apache Kafka,"Streaming Data from the Universe with Apache Kafka

How astronomers deploy real-time pipelines to distribute data from the millions of objects discovered each night by modern telescopes

Let’s build a news feed from the Universe!

You might think that data collection in astronomy consists of a lone astronomer pointing a telescope at a single object in a static sky. While that may be true in some cases (I collected the data for my Ph.D. thesis this way), the field of astronomy is rapidly changing into a data-intensive science with real-time needs. Each night, large-scale astronomical telescope surveys detect millions of changing objects in the sky and need to stream results to scientists for time-sensitive, complementary follow-up observations. This data pipeline is a great example of a use case for Apache Kafka ®.

Astronomy in real time

Observational astronomers study many different types of objects, from asteroids in our own solar system to galaxies that are billions of lightyears away. Though the timescales on which single astronomical objects change are generally on the order of millions of years, a telescope can detect millions of objects that appear to be changing on a single night. These objects, commonly known as transients, encompass a number of different phenomena including variable stars, gamma-ray bursts, supernova, and moving objects in the solar system like asteroids.

To detect and study these transient objects, many astronomers will collaborate on “sky survey” telescopes, which collect data by taking images as they sweep across the night sky instead of pointing at individual pre-selected targets. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an early pioneer of the survey technique, collecting tens of TBs of image data from nearly 1 billion objects. By taking the latest survey images of a swath of the sky and subtracting a previous reference image taken at the same location, astronomers can detect objects that change in brightness or have changed in position.

To fully characterize transient objects, astronomers need to gather data from other telescopes at different wavelengths at nearly the same time. Some phenomena, like supernova “shock breakouts,” may only last on the order of minutes. Astronomers need to be able to collect, process, characterize, and distribute data on these objects in near real time, especially for time-sensitive events.

Recently, a new sky survey came online with the specific aim of quickly detecting transient objects. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) images the entire Northern Sky every three nights. Using image differencing, ZTF detects about 1,000 objects in each image taken every 45 seconds, amounting to roughly 1 million changing objects per night. The data processing pipeline characterizes these objects, deriving key parameters such as brightness, color, ellipticity, and coordinate location, and broadcasts this information in alert packets.

The case for Apache Kafka

Until recently, the detection rate of transient objects was relatively low and put few requirements on the underlying technology of alert distribution mechanisms. For example, the Astronomer’s Telegrams (ATel), a web service allowing astronomers to manually post and broadcast alerts from transient object detections, has distributed on the order of tens of thousands of alerts since its inception in 1997. In order to distribute the alert data from ZTF’s roughly million of nightly detections, a fully automated and scalable streaming alert distribution is required.

Additionally, ZTF is a precursor survey for an even more technically challenging, upcoming astronomy project called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST is expected to detect about 10 million transient objects each night, an order of magnitude more than ZTF, with a nightly data stream size of 1–2 TB of messages. The technology underlying the ZTF system should be a prototype that reliably scales to LSST needs.

There were a number of factors we considered in designing an alert distribution for ZTF. First, we needed a system that would reliably distribute each alert message and could allow downstream listeners of the alert stream to rewind or catch up in real time, without losing data in the case of a dropped connection or a slow consumer. The existing standard alert distribution system, called the Virtual Observatory Event Transport Protocol, acts more as a broadcast system, transmitting alerts only if a user is connected. Kafka’s consumer offset management and the ability for consumers to rewind to the beginning of a topic are big draws.

Because these alerts are scientific quality data, an alert serialization format that preserves the integrity of the data so that it can be correctly interpreted by an end user scientist is imperative. For example, correctly storing numerical data as a double versus a float is a requirement for scientific calculations. The predominant existing astronomical alert format uses the semi-structured format XML. For alert stream rates low enough such that scientists can visually inspect messages, this format can definitely be appropriate. For alert rates of millions per night, scientists need a more structured data format for automated analysis pipelines. After researching formats-and reading about Confluent’s suggestion of using Avro with Kafka -we settled on using Avro, an open source, JSON-based binary format, for serializing the data in the alert messages. Avro has the benefits of:

Being very compact (as opposed to XML’s verbosity)

Being easy to characterize with simple JSON schemas

Supporting some degree of schema evolution

Having a couple of Python libraries for reading and writing data

Another requirement for the alert distribution system is ease of use for the end user. The end user in our case is most likely an astronomy researcher. Much of the code used by modern astronomers is written in Python, so the ZTF alert distribution system endpoints need to at least support Python. We built our alert distribution code in Python, based around Confluent’s Python client for Apache Kafka.

Alert data pipeline and system design

The ZTF telescope sits at the Palomar Observatory in California and takes images of the sky as it sweeps across at a rate of about one image every 45 seconds. The data then go through processing at CalTech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC). The images are cleaned to remove instrumental and atmospheric effects, as well as differenced to produce transient candidates. The data from these detections are then serialized into Avro binary format.

The Avro alert data schemas for ZTF are defined in JSON documents and are published to GitHub for scientists to use when deserializing data upon receipt. Part of the alert data that we need to distribute is a small cutout image (or “postage stamp”) of the transient candidate. With Avro, we can have data fields serialize as type bytes , which allows for the inclusion of binary format data, such as these image cutouts or generally any individual file:

Image cutouts from simulated data of a supernova detection. Left: Science image. Center: Template sky image. Right: Difference image constructed by subtracting the template from the science image.

Serialized alerts are produced to a Kafka broker, with each night’s data written to its own topic. Data older than two weeks is expired from Kafka. The IPAC’s Kafka broker is available to only two external consumer for security purposes-a downstream Kafka system at the University of Washington (UW) and another Kafka system in a commercial cloud, both using MirrorMaker to mirror available alert stream topics.

The University of Washington runs a cluster of three Kafka brokers, each deployed in a separate Docker container (built on top of Confluent’s Docker Hub images), that feeds a permanent data archive of Avro files and allows connections from a number of external collaborations of scientists focused on different subfields of astronomy. Topics are separated into 16 partitions so that consumers of the stream can parallelize readers into a group of up to 16 for faster reading and parallel downstream filtering and processing.

Diagram of the flow of alert data through the ZTF Alert Distribution System: Transient candidate alerts are submitted to a Kafka cluster at IPAC and mirrored at UW and a commercial cloud. Downstream filtering algorithms classify and separate different types of objects. End user scientists can subscribe to topics for objects of interest, and collaborations of scientists (known in the astronomical community as event brokers) can also subscribe and redistribute alerts enriched with additional external data.

The cloud-based Kafka system is public facing for other astronomy researchers. Scientists can write scientific filters to automatically apply algorithms such as classifiers to detect and tag different types of objects (e.g., supernova, variable stars, near-Earth objects). The filters can be written simply in Python and can be deployed separately in different Docker containers. Here is an example of the code a scientist would write:

class Filter001(AlertFilter):

def filter(self, alert):

if ((alert['source']['signal_level'] > 5) &

(alert['source']['brightness'] > 0.00003631)):

return True

else:

return False

For objects that pass a filter, the filter returns True , and the alert data message is then produced to a new topic just for that type of object that other scientists can then subscribe to.

Streaming millions of detections

The ZTF pipeline produces anywhere from 600,000 to 1.2 million alerts per night. We have stress tested the system up to 2 million alerts without any technical issues. Each alert packet is about 60 KB in size, dominated mostly by the cutout images, for a total volume of up to 70 GB of data pushed through the system each night. Serialized alert data is available to end users around 20 minutes after an image is taken on the telescope, with the majority of that time taken up by the image differencing pipeline. From the main Kafka distribution hub to external consumers, the transfer time is about four seconds.

Kafka has been a great tool for powering the tech behind attacking astronomical data distribution and data analysis pipeline challenges, meeting scalability demands, and enabling science in near real time. It is relatively easy to use and simple enough for a scientist to start prototyping with. I’ll be continuing to explore ways to work with it to enable real-time data science pipelines for projects here at High Alpha Studio.

“The More You Learn the More Questions You Have” — Pouria Kay,"Pouria, talking to the participants of his workshop at the School of Startups.

Pouria Kay, entrepreneur, co-founder and CEO of Grib, has been a good friend of The Shortcut from its beginning. Pouria’s story is an inspiring act on how one should follow the goals, have a passion to learn and give back to the community.

You might have met Pouria at the Startup Debut or workshops of the School of Startups. Pouria, whose adventures in the Finnish startup world started to bring positive results, agreed to share his experiences with The Shortcut.

It all started with a dream

“I decided to move to Finland already in 2009. I was working full-time, had two jobs simultaneously. I had finished my bachelor studies in Iran and career-wise everything was fine, but i felt that i needed to learn more and Iran wasn’t the environment for that. There’re social structural problems that do not allow you to learn especially if you’re young and too enthusiastic. I tried different ways and it didn’t work.”

“The more you learn the more questions you have.”

As I had lots of questions, I jumped into different areas. Back in Iran I started as a designer, doing small design processing in the advertising department. First I just wanted to improve the process, that led to the need of improving the whole PR and advertising, then I had to fix marketing and later the strategic planning and management too. Although I didn’t have enough time to study everything properly, going through that made me learn a lot. I also found that the more you learn the more questions you have.

“Although I didn’t know much about Finland, it seemed to be an environment where I could grow” Image by Marja Suurpalo

I started searching online where I could learn and what I could do about it. I found IDBM (International Design Business Management, Master’s program in Aalto University, that integrates business, design and technology — author’s note), which was starting for the first time as major. I was like “I’m going there!” I applied and I got in. Although I didn’t know much Finland except maybe a few general things that people know about the Nordics and seeing a bunch of pictures, Finland seemed to be an environment where I could grow, learn and develop.

“Finland is like home. I’m living here, I like the the environment, I want to stay here.”

It was the first time I was leaving Iran. I had several issues to solve in order to come here — military service, finances, visa, language exam. I had none of it. I started the planning seriously — “must have IELTS by this time, apply by this time, have this much money…” eventually I managed it all. It took a lot of effort and my friends were “Oh, you’re just lucky”. What was interesting is that I knew exactly what I was doing for the first time in my life and I’ve been focusing on one thing at a time. I’ve learned a lot from that. I came here for the studies and I wanted to do things. That led me where I am now.”

Saving humanity from annoying 3D software

“When I started Grib, I was already deep into the startup environment.When I got to Aalto, I got introduced to Startup Sauna, which was still a garage at that time. Ideas after ideas I started to help other startups.

My company was registered in 2016, but Grib itself started as a project in 2014, right after I graduated. Now we are in the stage of product development. We’re constantly looking for opportunities, learning, trying and seeing what we can do. I consider a product not just an app, for a startup a product could be the whole business model. We’re working hard on validating what we get to the market.”

Pouria found his new home in Finland.

Giving back to the community

“I got a lot and I’m still getting from the startup scene in Finland. It’s a good thing that people give back. The hard part is that everybody is trying to help and has very strong opinions, so some of the things you get are not necessarily right or good. Not everything I received was positive, but I guess it’s part of the learning. You hear different opinions and views, listen to them, learn and decide by yourself.

I wish there was some kind of system that would encourage everybody to share and give back. When you’re giving back you’re getting stronger. The dangerous side is that you also get stronger in your opinions, so you definitely need feedback. Circulation of information and feedback, I think it’s still missing.”

We need more “shortcuts” in the system

“It is important not to put 100 people to one box, but see each as individuals and understand what drives them, why they do what they do. Once you understand their drive, we can change the way we see them and can help more efficiently.

I’m not that far from the time I’ve been to that kind of environment, maybe 2–4 years ahead compared to the people who participated in the School of Startups. If I’m able to add anything then of course I’ll be around.

What helped me with Grib at the early stage were the mentors, I had very good mentors. For those who are at the very early steps, just having an idea, not even a concept, — the best mentors are the ones who’re just a bit ahead. It’s same with kids who are more likely to be influenced by other kids, — mentors are the ones who sit next to you, work with you through the process. If the person is a CTO of another 3 year old startup, that’s a great mentor for your tech idea. They have been through the same thinking, can see things the way you see it. It’s also good that each one gets connected to someone in industry. There are tons of people who have potential, but they’re disconnected.

One single channel can not do this, then The Shortcut may be a facilitator. I think The Shortcut is good and we also need others like The Shortcut in the system. Those are very effective.”",https://medium.com/the-shortcut/the-more-you-learn-the-more-questions-you-have-interview-with-pouria-kay-startup-notes-3a9b0d51afc5,Anna Pogrebniak,2018-09-18 12:46:14.007000+00:00,"Design,Stories,Finland,Entrepreneurship,Startup"
How to Paint Vivid Pictures with Your Words,"It feels like you’ve been staring at the computer screen for hours as you struggle to rewrite several paragraphs. You’re trying to capture in words the images in your head, but the sentences on the page sound lifeless and dull.

Maybe you’re writing a blog post about a recent trip you took, and you want your readers to hear the cacophony of the city’s traffic and see the neon signs drenching the street with color.

Or maybe you’re writing a sales page, and you want your readers to be able to envision themselves using your product. You want them to feel as if they’re already holding the product in their hands and can see how it will make their lives so much easier.

The ability to describe something vividly is an essential skill for every writer to master, no matter whether you’re a blogger, novelist, or copywriter.

Vivid descriptions transform your paragraphs from vague and boring to engrossing and memorable.

Of course, like any skill, it’s one that takes time and practice to master. But there are ways to speed up that process and instantly transform your writing.

One of the best ways to do that is to study the descriptions of expert writers and steal their techniques.

In today’s article, I’m going to do just that by diving into one of my favorite books: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald’s writing has always enchanted me. Whenever I need a bit of inspiration, I love to turn to a page at random and study how Fitzgerald makes the New York of the 1920s come alive.

When Fitzgerald describes one of Gatsby’s parties, you feel like you are weaving in and out of the crowds and can almost hear the jazz music spilling across the gardens.

I’m sure Fitzgerald never tried to tell a story to his friends, and then gave up with a shrug, saying, “I guess you had to be there.”

Let’s look at three simple techniques Fitzgerald uses to bring his writing to life and how we can use them in our writing too.

And an important note!

Before Fitzgerald became a novelist, he worked as a copywriter, creating slogans for billboards and signs in streetcars. So don’t think that these techniques are only for fiction writers.

Any writer can use them.

1. Add layers to your descriptions with metaphors and similes

Metaphors and similes are the first tool in Fitzgerald’s paintbox for splashing his descriptions with color.

If you already use metaphors and similes in your writing, that’s fantastic. We’ll look at some creative ways to make similes and metaphors even more powerful in this section.

If you don’t use metaphors and similes, here’s a quick explanation of what they are.

A metaphor or simile helps you take your description to another level by comparing two unlike things to each other as if they were alike. The only difference between them is that similes use the words “like” or “as” (the wind sounded like a moan) and metaphors do not (the wind moaned).

Okay, let’s look at how Fitzgerald uses similes and metaphors to enhance the images in his writing.

Here’s one example:

The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.

First, these similes help us better visualize the scene. Here’s what it would sound like without them:

The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were seated. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering.

A bit boring, right? Without the similes, there isn’t really anything to make that scene stand out.

Second, they help set a mood for the paragraph.

While Fitzgerald isn’t writing a fantasy novel, by using similes about balloons and flying women, he’s able to give this scene an otherworldly feel.

In a way, they’re like mini-stories within a story.

Let’s look at the metaphor Fitzgerald uses in the last line of the book to see how these mini-stories can add depth to our own writing:

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

This is one of the most quoted lines from The Great Gatsby, and for good reason. Instead of just writing something like, “We try to move forward, but keep returning to the past”, Fitzgerald elevates this simple idea by using the imagery of boats.

Yes, the reader might say, that’s how I feel too. I’m trying to escape the past but feel like I’m rowing against the current.

Wrapped in a metaphor, the idea is no longer vague, but tangible.

So how can we effectively use metaphors and similes in our own writing?

Here are several tips:

First, you can use a simile to deepen your descriptions (as Fitzgerald does) or to better explain a complex concept or idea.

For example: “In order to perform this exercise, lie on your stomach, place your hands on the floor under your shoulders, and lift your chest off the floor as if you were a cobra.”

(Read my article here for more tips on how to explain complex ideas with similes and stories.)

Second, you can use similes and metaphors to weave your personality into your writing.

For example, say you love to play the piano, and you’re writing an article about blogging. You might write something like,

I love to play piano, and I soon realized that blogging and playing the piano are alike in a lot of ways. Just like you need to practice the piano every day if you want to improve your skills, you need to write consistently on your blog in order become a better blogger.

Third, you can use a simile or metaphor to evoke a specific feeling in your readers.

Blue Apron does that on their homepage by comparing their recipes to creating magic. This imagery makes us think that cooking Blue Apron’s recipes must be easy and the food will taste delicious:

Create magic…Following our step-by-step instructions you’ll experience the magic of cooking recipes that our chefs create with your family’s tastes in mind.

CitiBike also uses a simple but clever metaphor on their website:

Unlock a bike…unlock New York.

It is important to think of metaphors and similes like salt and pepper, however. A little sprinkle, and they’ll season your writing. But too many and you’re writing will be way too salty or way too spicy. A simile or metaphor in every sentence or paragraph will slow down the writing and detract from the specialness of each one. (Did you notice the simile I used in this paragraph?)

Fitzgerald uses metaphors and similes sparingly throughout the book, but when he does use them, they make you sit up and take notice.

2. Make descriptions delight the five senses with sensory words

Sensory words are the next tool that Fitzgerald employs to help readers become immersed in his story.

Sometimes sensory words sparkle, sometimes they clang, other times they’re bristly. Sometimes they’re bitter, other times delicious. Sometimes they have a fragrant aroma.

In short, sensory words are the descriptive words that apply to the five senses:

Words related to sight or appearance (these can also include words related to motion) — gleaming, tarnished, shadowy, sparkling, dancing

(these can also include words related to motion) — gleaming, tarnished, shadowy, sparkling, dancing Words related to touch — velvety, icy, sharp, blunt

— velvety, icy, sharp, blunt Words related to taste — bitter, zesty, refreshing

— bitter, zesty, refreshing Words related to scent — musty, fragrant, sweet

— musty, fragrant, sweet Words related to sound — roar, sizzle, murmur

See a list of more sensory words here.

Sensory words help you engage your readers’ five senses. They make your readers touch, taste, smell, hear, and see your descriptions.

Here are two sentences from The Great Gatsby that are filled with sensory words:

The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktailmusic and the opera of voices pitches a key higher…The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath–already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.

Of course, in a work of fiction that type of description is captivating. But in a blog post or on another page of your website, you would probably want to be a little less poetic. And, yet, you can still use sensory words effectively.

Look at how Bose uses sensory words in a product description for their headphones:

Tiny earbuds for better sleep. Noise-masking sleep buds. Unwanted noise keeping you awake at night? You’re not alone. That’s why we created a new solution. These tiny, comfortable and truly wireless earbuds are uniquely engineered to deliver soothing sounds that mask annoying noise — like snoring, pets, and loud neighbors — and help you fall asleep and stay asleep. So you can look forward to bedtime and be ready to take on tomorrow.

How many did you spot? Sound: noise-masking, soothing, snoring, loud. Touch: comfortable. Sight & Appearance: tiny, wireless.

3. Zoom-in on your descriptions with a list of details

Fitzgerald’s third technique is quite simple. I call it “the detailed list”.

Take this paragraph as an example:

He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher–shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue.

Fitzgerald could have ended the sentence at “he took a pile of shirts and began throwing them,” but he wanted us to be able to visualize the scene, to see the types of shirts that Gatsby wore.

So he zooms-in on them. He lists all of the different types of shirts.

Here’s another sentence that burst with a detailed list:

By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived–no thin five-piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums.

Again, Fitzgerald uses the detailed list in order to create a specific image in our head. This wasn’t just any orchestra — it was lavish.

Detailed lists can be used in any kind of writing. On sales pages, they’re often used to emphasize a product’s many features. Here’s an example from the sales page for the Kindle Paperwhite:

Won’t tire your eyes in the dark (Unlike back-lit tablets that shine in your eyes, Kindle guides light toward the surface of the display with its built-in front light so you can read comfortably for hours without eyestrain.) Learn more about a book before you start reading (With About this Book, see background information about the author, other books in the series, and more) Adjust your text size (choose from eight text sizes to prevent tired eyes and keep you reading longer)

Of course, if you crammed every one of your sentences with a list of details, your reader would become exhausted.

But just as you can sprinkle metaphors and similes like salt and pepper, you can use detailed lists when you’re struggling to make a description more vibrant or when you want to make sure that your readers are picturing the correct image in their heads.

The Takeaway

While Fitzgerald was a masterful writer, these three techniques are simple and straightforward. You can start using them right away to add zest to your descriptions.

When you transform bland paragraphs, you’re better able to hold the attention of your readers. And thus you’re more effective at sharing your message with the world.",https://medium.com/copywriting-secrets/how-to-paint-vivid-pictures-with-your-words-67aa70c00830,Nicole Bianchi,2019-05-21 22:12:00.279000+00:00,"Marketing,Self Improvement,Writing,Writing Tips,Creativity"
"How Pets Can Make You a Better Programmer — Yes, Your Pet Can Do That","Creative Thinking Skills

Creative thinking is an essential skill when it comes to programming and the software industry. You are required to think outside-the-box to tackle unsolved problems.

Here are a few ways of how your pets increase your creative thinking skills.

Keeps your mind active and sharp

Pets give us a sense of purpose and obligation. They depend on us for food, shelter, and security. Caring for your pet needs not only physical effort but also mental effort. You need to be able to communicate with your pet and stay tuned to the needs of your pet.

You may not know this, but really, your pet helps keep your mind more active and sharp. From meeting your pet’s basic needs to playing and enjoying time with your pet, they help to stimulate your mind and keep your brain in shape.

The mind is your most complicated and powerful resource, and the more you use it, the more creative and sharp it becomes. Having your mind active helps you produce creative output because the creative process is also cyclical — the more creative thinking you use, the more motivated you become.

Start thinking about caring for your pet as a creative tool and you’re sure to enjoy those walks and playtimes even more.

Provides a childlike sense of joy and freedom

Pets often bring out some of the best characteristics in ourselves. They will help us explore and reconnect with that more carefree and childlike existence.

You will find that when you’re with your pet, you’re more happy and relaxed. You might even find yourself doing dumb, out-of-the-box things while you play and spend time with your cat.

It’s that very sense of joy and freedom that our pets can provide that can also help to boost our creativity. When you were younger and more carefree, you were less logical and judgmental; you believed in infinite possibilities.

A more youthful outlook, filled with wonder and curiosity, is a great approach to the creative process. Let yourself be shrewd and dumb next time you play with your dog, and see how your creative juices can sparkle.",https://medium.com/better-programming/how-pets-can-make-you-a-better-programmer-yes-your-pet-can-do-that-450cc63962f8,Mahdhi Rezvi,2020-09-24 01:42:15.838000+00:00,"Mental Health,Health,Software Engineering,Programming,Lifestyle"
How AI can add value and viability to your business application ?,"If you are a tech geek or a business owner with a website or mobile application, one of the terms that you come across most frequently would certainly be artificial intelligence or one of its multi-branched technologies like machine learning, data mining, etc. If you have wondered what all this hype is all about, think no more. You have landed in the right page. In this article, we will be discussing how artificial intelligence can add value to your business.

Firstly, let us understand what artificial intelligence is! AI is the ability of the systems to respond to the inputs received, without being implicitly trained for it. This is possible with the use of algorithms, usage analysis, data-sets and other cognitive observations. Even though there are talks that AI will replace the human labor, AI has only been able to help humans in their day-to-day mundane tasks. Thus making their lives easier and also helping them concentrate on the more complex jobs that actually need their attention.

Let us discuss some ways in AI can add value to a business:

Improved customer relations:

It can be agreed upon without much of a debate that one of the jobs that has a very bland routine is that of customer service and support where an agent (Human) has to answer to the same questions over and over again. Many a times the quality of customer service and support in many of the companies decreases rapidly because of this reason. Deploying AI for this has proved to be one of the most successful applications of AI. Virtual Customer Assistants (VCAs) are becoming very popular these days with most of the businesses using a chatbot or a similar technology that makes use of technologies like predictive analysis, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, etc. which are all derivatives of artificial intelligence.

Machine learning:

Are you into the business of marketing? If yes, then I’m assuming you have already started using artificial intelligence in your business to ensure you stay at the top of it. But if your answer is no. then here is why you should no longer wait to get AI into business! Cognitive learning, popularly known as machine learning is a technology that enables systems to learn from previous inputs and make a decision. This can be used in marketing business by deploying various algorithms to understand what a customer is looking for when he or she visits a website or an app. You can also analyse their movement and help them navigate in a better way.

Data to Text Conversion:

For an app to successfully run a lot of databases and data-sets are loaded and ensured that the end user can use the app successfully. But many a times it so happens that that database is so complicated that users find it impossible to use the application. This can be avoided by using data conversion or the natural language processing technology (NLP) to ensure that all the data at the back end is converted into a language that can be easily understood by the users.



Audio to text conversion:

Gone are those days where the only way to input data into an application or website was by typing. All one has to do now would be to just speak to the websites or applications for them to analyse the input and generate the required output. This has been possible only because of the technology called speech recognition. Some of the popular examples of this technology could be Alexa by Amazon, Siri by Apple or Google Assistant by Google.

By now you must have understood about the potential of AI in adding value to your business. If you need any further assistance feel free to contact our team of experts for bringing AI into your business to scale it to new heights.

How can atmospheric pollution result to excessive harm in the marine ecosystems?,"How can atmospheric pollution result to excessive harm in the marine ecosystems? Ioannis Dedes Follow Dec 26 · 5 min read

Photo by NOAA on Unsplash

It is obvious that when one discusses how humans disturb and negatively affect the atmospheric system, the focus is based on the pollution and the effect of the excessive quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there’s less or no concentration on how the disturbance of the atmospheric system can negatively contribute to the harm on marine ecosystems.

Regardless of the focus on this connection, this text is a simple guide that can raise awareness and clearly show the impact that generally human intervention and more specifically carbon emissions, can have on aquatic ecosystems since they threaten the ocean and have a negative effect for entire food webs and chains. It’s more than important to understand the correlation of the two systems, the atmospheric and the aquatic, and be well aware of the fact that our harmful actions for the pollution of the air are equally and sometimes even more disruptive for the marine ecosystems and equilibria.

As stated before, the text is dedicated more on the single perspective of burning fossil fuels and generally, carbon dioxide emissions they can produce, along with other harmful activities. At first sight, one might say that oceans work as a mechanism that absorbs 25% to 40% of the carbon dioxide emitted in the air and actually slows the rate of global warming. Please don’t get me wrong; this is a great outcome for the absorption of this polluting substance. It’s considered great, however, until one understands the second part of the ‘story’. The CO2 quantities which are absorbed by the oceans do not disappear; they come together with water molecules, dissolve them, and create an acidic substance called carbonic acid.

Carbonic acid can be easily ‘broken down’ to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions, solutions in which the acidity is found in excessive levels. This is obviously a great contribution for the destruction of marine systems since the increasing acidity levels in the water can seriously harm the diversity of populations, habitats and plants of the oceans. After reading my last article on the environment, which raises awareness on the importance of the Amazon rainforest, one can easily understand how water acidity will work at the expense of marine ecosystems and in this particular case, the diversity of the river.

Another negative mechanism which is caused by atmospheric pollution and it’s attached to the acidic character of the above-mentioned case is the change of the wind patterns; cases of this outcome are particularly found in the Pacific Ocean. A change in the wind patterns can lead to a push of the waters on the surface aside and acidic water can rise up to the shore. Both the previous one and this case may have the negative effect of leading to greater water acidity; the phenomenon of ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is the increase of the acid and the decrease of pH in the oceans, caused by the substance of carbon dioxide. Lower pH means higher acidity, the inability of many organisms to adapt and the disruption of food chains, as shown below.

One example that should be evaluated and which ecompasses both effects of the mechanism mentioned above is the 2005 to 2008 Pacific Northwest extinction of millions of shellfish larvae. It was considered a mysterious extinction and it took way too long for the researchers to understand that the acidity of the waters was damaging the organisms’ population and that that low pH was causing the dissolution of shells. Furthermore, scientists discovered that a big number of marine organisms build their skeletons and shells from calcium carbonate, which is vulnerable to acid and after specifically two months, it completely dissolves and skeletons cannot be built properly in the water of low pH. Despite the fact that the vast deaths of the shellfish larvae urged scientists to research and figure out what happened, this population hasn’t fully recovered yet and as carbon continues to make water more acidic, the more vulnerable the skeletons and the shells will be.

In addition, there are other case studies that show us how the decrease in pH can lead to disturbance of food webs and ecosystems as a whole. Another example is about the organisms of crustaceans, a species being even more affected by the acidity in the water. This species cannot control the dissolution of acid in their shells and as a result they can easily die. This poses a threat for many ecosystems as crustaceans are primary consumers and are precious for many marine ecosystems. This could result in disruption of the reproductive cycle or the complete disruption and disturbance of the ecosystems, as these species pass a great amount of energy from the plants to the consumers when healthy. This comes in accordance with one of my previous articles that it’s based on the positive feedback mechanisms’ effects on biodiversity and is found below (although the focus is on different ecosystems the theory is the same).

As the writer, I would personally advise the reader to dedicate a greater extent of his time in understanding this particular correlation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, caused by human activities, which after all, can also doesn’t only affect terrestrial and atmospheric ecosystems but also poses a great threat to the marines; the examples are used to show that this is frequently the case and acidity doesn’t only harm small organisms which are irrelevant to the greater water ecosystem but it can be deadly for precious populations and parts of the greater food chains and webs.",https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/how-atmospheric-pollution-can-result-to-excessive-harm-in-the-marine-ecosystems-922fc295a258,Ioannis Dedes,2020-12-28 12:42:46.667000+00:00,"Environment,Diversity,Future,Sustainability,Climate Change"

Examples and tips to attract readers to your valuable content

Headlines aren’t an exact science. What may get one reader clicking may be ignored by another. What may work in one industry may not work in another. However, there are simple, classic ways to improve headlines so they’re more likely to entice your reader.

Over the past decade as a communications professional and a writer, I’ve made a crapload of mistakes with headlines. But when you write to sell — ideas, products, services, event tickets, and more — you get feedback. That’s how you quickly learn what headlines sell — and which flop.

Today I want to show you ten headlines from real articles. I’ll take you through how to improve them — and share alternative headline ideas. Are the alternative headlines better than the originals? I’ll let you decide.",https://medium.com/better-marketing/10-easy-fixes-for-common-headline-mistakes-21ab58e80836,Cynthia Marinakos,2020-04-02 22:05:45.881000+00:00,"Creativity,Business,Headline Hacks,Productivity,Writing"
"Understanding Transgender, for Cis Folks","This neurological view of mismatch aversion has had profound repercussions for our understanding of several other types of body dysphorias. Among these is the feeling that a person’s gender identity differs from their body gender, which is gender dysphoria. Quite literally, the person is born with a mind, a soul, whose gender fails to match that of the body in which it finds itself:

During fetal development, different aspects of sexuality are set in motion in parallel: sexual morphology (external anatomy), sexual identity (what you see yourself as), sexual orientation (what sex you are attracted to), and sexual body image (your brain’s internal representation of your body parts). [These typically] harmonize during physical and social development… but they can become uncoupled, leading to deviations that shift the individual toward one or the other end of the spectrum of normal distribution. (Ramachandran)

It’s important to understand that this isn’t a binary situation. Sex and gender exist as a broad spectrum of manifestations, both in the body and the soul. (I am using the term “soul” here to refer to a person’s conscious experience, the sentient mind, because at the end of the day that is what souls are.) Yes, there is a bell-curve to it, and some physical and mental manifestations of sex and gender are much more common than others. But the point is, the experience of “being” a person of a certain gender — wherever on the spectrum that may fall — while having the body of a different sort of gender is rooted in biological reality.

So it is simply not correct to say that a person who is trans-male was born “biologically female” or that a person who is trans-female was born “biologically male”. Our brains and our genitalia are all part of our biology. What is correct is that they were born transgender.

It’s not possible to fully imagine what being a transgender person actually feels like if you are not one, just as it’s not possible to fully imagine what it’s like being any different gender. But imagining how you might feel should at least open the door to compassion and understanding for folks who are going through something which you haven’t, and are dealing with it and living their lives the best way they see to do so, according to their choices.

But where we, as a society, have the most trouble figuring out how to approach the reality of transgendered people is in dealing with children who experience mismatch aversion involving their sexual identities. On the one hand, our laws generally hold that prepubescent children cannot understand sexual maturity and therefore cannot be in a position to reasonably consent to anything having to do with it. Therefore, some people reason, it is a form of child abuse to begin any sort of gender transition in young kids who express their experience of feeling that they “are” a different sex than their genitalia would indicate. What if it’s just a phase? Or rebellion? What if they don’t understand the profound consequences of the process, that it’s not the same thing as playing dress-up?

On the other hand, we would do well to consider the very real terror of a gender-mismatched child with a boy’s body map, but a little girl’s body, facing the prospect of developing breasts and a uterus capable of bearing children. Or a gender-mismatched child with a girl’s body map, but a little boy’s body, anticipating the inevitable development of an enlarged penis and testicles, a deep voice, and a beard. If you are cis-gendered, imagine being told at that age that your own body was soon to grow into the adult form of the opposite gender, and knowing that the metamorphosis drew nearer with each passing day.

As long as outdated notions persist of gender mismatch as a social or psychological problem, rather than an innate issue of biology and neurology, of genuine and innate identity, we are passively dooming these kids to what is now at least a partially avoidable fate. And we are dooming ourselves to using inappropriate instruments to assess the situation and determine the best course of action in each individual case. This does not mean that we start prescribing hormone therapy to every tomboy who says “I hate being a girl” or to any little boy who says he’d rather join the Brownies than the Cub Scouts. It does mean that when children start indicating that they identify as a gender other than the one on their birth certificate, they are assured that they are not crazy, and we begin exploring the possibility that gender mismatch might be the issue.

And as cis-gendered adults, by understanding that gender mismatch is biologically real, we can start treating folks who gender-identify in different ways from ourselves with the respect and dignity they deserve as fellow humans. We can stop demeaning others and insisting that they’re seeking attention or in need of counseling to set them right. We can stop assuming that our own body-mind alignment is “correct” rather than merely common. And stop labeling a neurological configuration as a “sickness” or “perversion”.

"Sorry, More Bad News. Your Writing is Being Ripped Off As I Type This.","See? It’s writing stolen from Gillian. And aside from the author name at the top of the collection page, the rest of the credits are stripped out. If you click any of the articles, there’s no author credit. No link to Medium. Nothing to take you back to Gillian. They just stole her writing.

Mine are there, too. Just not as many of them. Maybe yours are there, too.

There’s only one place you can write and not have your writing ripped off. In a notebook.

And I’m sorry. Sorry to be the one to tell you that. But it’s the ugly truth of the internet. Anything you put online will be ripped off by some jerk.

Right now there’s a whole bunch of writers kind of in a panic and trying to figure out how to shut those sites down.

— Omg, email namecheap, they’re the registrar.

— Email the site.

— Email the web-host.

We gotta shut them DOWN!

And I understand feeling that. But still? Good luck with that.

Look, I get it. I’m a writer, too.

I’ve been a writer for a really long time. First time I had an article published in a print magazine was 1996. Long time! I’ve written online so long, I forget all the places I’ve written. Wordpress. Open Salon. Too many to remember.

I get it. Our writing means something to us. Okay? I get that.

Dr Mehmet Yildiz wrote about the ichi.pro site and one commenter said if Medium doesn’t “deal with it” then they’re condoning it.

No, they’re not.

Do you even know the procedure required to shut down plagiarist site? Most people don’t.

First thing to understand is that in order to get a site taken down, you must file a take-down request. With proof of why the site needs to come down.

Because plagiarism itself isn’t a crime. It’s the copyright infringement that results in the shut down.

1) Normally, a take down would be filed with the web-hosting company. Because technically speaking, they are the ones hosting the copyright infringed content.

So you need to find the hosting company.

Provided it’s not masked.

Because domain masking is a thing. Any one of us can register a domain name and set up IP masking so that the “real” hosting company doesn’t show anywhere. Most hosting resellers do it all the time.

I run a tiny hosting company. Just for my design clients. If you ran a whois on the sites I host, it will show you my domain. Not the hosting company that provides my allotted servers in the NOC (network operations center).

So that’s hurdle one.

Find the hosting company. Hope they’re not masked. If looking up the hosting company leads you back to the plagiarist, you’re at a dead end. At least for most people.

If you’re technical, you could try traceroute and see where it leads you.

Also? Hope they’re in a country that accepts take down requests.

Some countries don’t do take-downs. Hosted in China or Russia? Forget it. They don’t deal with it. They don’t do take-downs. They don’t even respond.

See, plagiarism itself isn’t a crime. It should be, but it’s not.

The issue with plagiarism is that it can lead to a copyright infringement claim. Unless the person you want to sue is in China. Or Russia. Or similar countries, because there’s no shortage of countries that allow ripped off sites and don’t deal with copyright claims. They don’t care.

If they have no problem knocking off GUCCI handbags, they sure have no problem stealing content from you or me. We’re small fry.

Ichi.pro is not in English. You think they’re hosted in America? Think again. That site isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Not if it’s hosted in China or Russia or somewhere overseas.

Maybe you get lucky!

You find the host. They agree to take it down. Most often, the site just moves to another host. You can chase them until one of you gets tired. Or they move offshore. There’s lots of hosting offshore where complaints aren’t dealt with.

It’s not just writers, either…

I’m kind of a polymath. As in, I have lots of weird hobbies. For example? I restore vintage and antique fonts and lettering.

There’s a lot of fancy lettering from the 1600s to 1800s. Mostly, a few letters here and there, found in old illuminated manuscripts that have long ago gone into the public domain. People who love lettering love those old books.

One font I made? All I had to start with was 6 characters. Just half a dozen pretty letters in a tattered old 300 year old book.

But from 6 letters, you can see stroke patterns. Serif characteristics. You can see the art that the calligrapher was creating. The feel. The flow.

Hundreds of hours. Hundreds.

Slowly creating letters to match those 6 until I created an entire font from old lost letters that some letterer penned into a book 300 years ago.

Some jerk in Russia bought my font. Opened it in a font program and renamed it. And he’s selling it.

I could cry.

More weird hobbies… stuff you didn’t know about me.

I also sell my photography. And digital templates for writers. So you can open my bundles in Canva or Photoshop and make kick butt graphics to promote your books. Those have been stolen, too. For sale on Russian sites.

Here’s a weird one. I have a skill for pattern drafting. I’ve sewn for the Olympic dancers, which was a hoot, and I have my own pattern line.

They’re digital downloads. My customers live in areas where they can’t buy patterns readily. They love being able to print them out.

You guessed it. Yup. Those have been stolen, too.

My book was stolen, too...

Marketing is my day job. Many years ago, I first hit the news media when I took a company from bankrupt to a million in 18 months flat. And then did it again with the next client.

My before and after stories were featured in Forbes, The New York Times and more. I was so excited when I wrote a marketing book for small business owners. When I sent it to my list, I made a month’s income in a day.

That got stolen, too. I took mine offline. They might still be selling it, for all I know. Likely not. They probably milked it and moved on.

This stuff can break you if you let it.

It happens to freebies, too. And Google will help!

Almost any book that has a digital version — someone is giving it away free. The bigger you get, the more likely it happens to you.

For that matter, Google will help.

I shouldn’t even be telling you this, but here… do this… Go to Google advanced search. Do a keyword or wildcard search and search for pdf files. You know what I mean by wildcard, right?

Type in marketing or *marketing* and select pdf as the file type to search for.

Google will give you a whole bunch of stuff. Some of it free, some of it paid. You just need to mess around a bit.

Fact is, if people selling digital goods don’t know how to lock them down, people are grabbing them free. Sometimes for themselves. Other times to share them in black-hat forums and on the dark web.

And if you’re selling on a third-party site where you don’t control the download process, then you have no ability to control that.

It’s ugly, and it’s fact. And it happens every hour of every day.

If anyone says you can get all those thieves shut down, they’re full of crap. Because you can only get them shut down if the host will comply. In China or Russia or the may offshore countries — nah. They don’t care.

So what do you do about theft of your work? You try not to think about it. And that truly sucks.

Trust me, it sucks. My work means something to me, whether it’s a Medium piece that took 5 hours to research, write and edit — or a font I put hundreds of hours into, lettering by hand, scanning, kerning and digitizing.

What’s the option?

Doing nothing?

Letting those people snuff the light that makes me who I am? So I hide my writing away in notebooks and keep my lettering and patterns on scraps of paper in a binder and die with all my dreams unborn? No. Screw that.

One of the sites I sell my fonts on has a member community. It’s one of those old archaic BBS systems. People talk about theft there. A lot.

The new members are always stunned. Shocked.

First time it happens, they’re just broken. They want to know how to make it stop. How to shut down the thief. Because there must be a way, right?

One of the top font sellers there sighs.

You can’t, she says. You just try not to think about it. Don’t think about how much sales you lost to them. Don’t wonder how much they’re earning on your work. Just pray that in the long run, it brings you more name recognition. Because no one can make it stop. Not until all countries play by the same rules. That’s never going to happen. There will always be a place that doesn’t care…

It hurts.

And we can’t make it stop.

Not as long as there are people who steal. Not as long as there are countries who don’t deal with intellectual property theft, and off-shore web-hosts that do not honor a take down request.

It’s real simple. If you don’t want your work stolen, don’t put it on the internet. There really isn’t another solution.

That’s not to say you shouldn’t try. Maybe the host will cooperate.

Maybe. But don’t count on it. And don’t let it break you.

I’m sorry. It sucks to be the bearer of bad news.

But I’d rather bring bad news than delude people.

Selling Your New Sales Deck to Sales,"Bellies full of beignets, my parents and I were exiting San Francisco’s Just for You Cafe when when a middle-aged man called my name.

“Andy, it’s Christoph!” he shouted. “Do you have time for a quick question about messaging?”

(Later, my mom asked, “People stalk you for messaging advice?”)

It was fun having my parents think I was some kind of messaging celebrity, but I recognized Christoph as the CEO of an early-stage tech company who had recently attended one of my workshops. He was waiting for a table, but didn’t wait to tell me what was going on.

“Listen,” he said, “I restructured our sales pitch using your Greatest Sales Deck framework and the results have been awesome. I’ve used it with a few prospects, and they engage at a deeper level, they get what we’re about faster, and they’re all moving to next steps.”

“That’s great,” I said. “What’s the question?”

“Well, it’s my VP of sales. He won’t even look at the new deck. Says he already has a deck, and that buyers don’t have time for a story, they just want to know how we solve their problem.” Christoph was digging his heels into the pavement, one after the other, as a metaphor for his VP’s resistance. “How do I bring him on board?”

With so many B2B teams gearing up for next year’s sales kickoff events, I’m guessing Christoph isn’t the only one worried about his sales team embracing a new version of the pitch. So I’ll share an expanded version of my response to him here:

(These 5 points are particularly relevant to the Greatest Sales Deck framework, but should apply to any kind of sales pitch.)

#1. Make sure your new deck facilitates discovery

Christoph’s VP’s complaint echoes the most common pushback I hear from salespeople about flashy new sales decks in general—they encourage salespeople to blabber on instead of listening to prospects. In other words, they inhibit what salespeople call discovery.

One of my biggest “aha” moments was when several sales teams I worked with began using their “change in the world” slides to get prospects talking and opening up. For example, Switzerland-based SpotMe, which delivers custom apps for events and training, begins pitches by sharing a change that we heard about from SpotMe’s customers—namely that they now see events not as self-contained shindigs, but as episodes in some greater journey:",https://medium.com/firm-narrative/selling-your-new-sales-deck-to-sales-a7dc032a57bb,Andy Raskin,2018-10-30 18:08:17.893000+00:00,"Sales,Entrepreneurship,Startup,Marketing,Strategy"

I Hope This Pandemic Has Taught Us That Products Can’t Replace People

We are social creatures

Photo by Dương Nhân from Pexels

Have you found yourself spending endless time on shopping apps over the course of the pandemic, either window shopping or actually buying stuff, just getting lost in the sea of products out there, hoping to find something that will make you just a little bit happier?

If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably spent more time in an app like Amazon or eBay than your dwindling checking account is comfortable with (don’t worry, your secrets are safe with me).

According to Adobe’s analytics, by April this year, buy-online-pickup-in-store, also known as BOPIS, sales had surged a whopping 208% from last year. Overall e-commerce rose a massive 25% in just two weeks in March 2020.

Vivek Pandya, Adobe’s Digital Insights Manager, told Forbes, “According to our data, it would’ve taken between 4 and 6 years to get to the levels that we saw in May if the growth continued at the same levels it was at for the past few years.”

But switching from in-person shopping to online is only part of the equation. While some of us are converting from brick-and-mortar stores to digital apps and online retailers, others are shopping more in total because they feel lonely, sad, and isolated. The COVID-19 pandemic has only deepened another epidemic: the loneliness epidemic.

And there’s vicious cycle at work…

COVID-19 forces us to rely on social media for our interaction, social media and a lack of interaction can possibly deepen loneliness, and loneliness makes many of us shop more in search of fulfillment — but shopping never really fills the emptiness.

Why do we do this? Do we secretly believe that we can’t be happy without the fanciest chair massager or the coolest new tech toy? The answer seems to be both yes and no.

Looking around at American advertising literature, you’d be tempted to believe that our goods are what make us happy in life. In fact, we’ve erected an entire society predicated on this idea. It’s the idea that buying the right objects is the golden ticket to happiness. The standard model of consumer culture, as I call it.

It’s a model of life complete with pushy sales guys and telemarketing callers, people everywhere who try to leverage this fundamental and dogmatic idea that you can’t be happy without a certain product or service. More than this, the goal of advertising, and our culture at large, is often to convince you that just buying a certain product or service will solve all of your life’s woes.

But is that really true?

There’s quite a bit of evidence says otherwise. And some have suggested that even the purchasing of goods, not even services or experiences, are done with the belief that they’ll inevitably lead to positive social encounters in the future.

Buying things, so the theory goes, only helps us insofar as we think they’ll be instrumental in creating or maintaining human connections for us at some point down the road. At the bottom of all consumption is the desire to be loved and accepted.

Steve Quartz is the co-author of the book Cool: How the Brain’s Hidden Quest for Cool Drives Our Economy and Shapes Our World, and his theories fit nicely with the indescribable feelings that I think so many of us are feeling right now.

Some of the very first human ornaments in the form of jewelry was made approximately 70,000 years ago. These ornaments are thought to have symbolized membership in certain human tribes. Much more than a decorative feature alone, they helped people to feel like they belonged to a like-minded group of people they could trust and count on. They were icons that symbolized the interconnectedness of the group.

In his research, Quartz came to the conclusion that most of the products that drive our consumer economy are based on the perceived social value we think they’ll yield. It’s not about the intrinsic value of the pleasure so much as the perceived status and sense of belonging we believe we’ll receive from most human purchases. As Quartz says:

We can do this because our medial prefrontal cortex works as a sort of social calculator that monitors our perceptions of other people’s judgments of us, a sort of self-esteem inner gauge. It creates our basic need to feel the face-to-face admiration and respect we obtain in groups. In fact, psychologists have discovered that our happiness depends more on this feeling of esteem and respect than on our socioeconomic status.

Quartz continues:

In fact, much of the economic value of products today lies in their impact on our brain’s mostly implicit estimate of how they impact our social identity….We found that boosts in our social status also strongly activate the nucleus accumbens, a critical part of the brain’s reward system that’s implicated in almost all forms of addiction. Other studies with college students found that they value self-esteem boosts even more than sex! But I would urge you not to view these as some misbegotten vanity. Feeling esteemed and respected by others is a basic and universal human need that makes possible the human bonds that underlie cooperative human social life. It’s no surprise that it taps into the brain’s most powerful reward systems.

And now that the pandemic has locked us in for months on end, the flaws in the standard model of consumerism are becoming exposed to even greater degrees, as we all sit alone and isolated, unable to engage in the meaningful activities we once were able to with ease.

Most of us find ourselves plagued by this haunting feeling that something isn’t quite right, even if we’re conveniently shopping from home with free same-day delivery.

And I think that feeling of unease is the fact that our natural social reward systems have been interrupted.

The products themselves aren’t enough to provide the joy people get from consumption without the ability to share their experiences with others.

Usually when we buy something, say a new dress or an interesting t-shirt, we do so with the implication that the people we care about will give us approval for it. From heavy metal band t-shirts to Sunday church outfits, humans crave interaction from the products they consume, as Quartz pointed out.

When we have our outings and engage with other people, seeing the smiles on their face, engaging in the kinds of chatter we enjoy, we receive positive feedback.

Ah, validation, at last!

But now that we’re far removed from one another, socially isolated and physically distanced, that feedback system has become dramatically interrupted. The Internet is no substitute for in-person validation and a sense of belonging. And this transcends the fashion industry.

As I write this story, I’m enjoying a delicious plate of mango habanero cauliflower wings. I’m watching an entertaining NFL football game on my iMac screen in a brand new comfortable chair. By all material metrics, I’ve got the life. And while all of these things are great, I still feel like something is missing. It’s not the same as sports were pre-pandemic, as any sports fan should know. What’s missing is the human element.

Athletes play in nearly empty stadiums for atomized crowds-of-one huddled around screens, scattered about like autumn leaves just beginning to fall. There’s no cohesion, there’s no sense of connection that drives the social experience.

It’s not the same without the crowd, the friends jumping up and down and screaming about the scores and more. The excitement is missing. It’s watered down. The experience is more sterile.

And the same goes for our eating. Food is a universal human bonding experience and it has been since prehistoric men and women bonded over the fires that kept them warm, safe, and alive.

And while I won’t say that it’s a bad thing to eat alone, it’s a wonderful experience to treat yourself to a restaurant all alone, doesn’t it become a little problematic eating alone every single night? It does. It’s not quite the same without the social connection that drives our consumption, be it the consumption of food, professional sports, or fashion.

When we feel loneliness, and our culture doesn’t facilitate reasonable outlets to solve the problem of social isolation, we often buy things secretly hoping we’ll feel more connected, only to be let down by the fact that products can’t replace people. Usually for me, this just makes the feeling of loneliness worse.

Did you know the World Health Organization has declared loneliness as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day? Well, they have, calling it the silent pandemic. And social isolation has been long believed to be the single biggest risk factor for human violence.

In reality, we need each other. We all need to feel a sense of belonging that helps us stay grounded, feel connected, and to understand ourselves through the refractive lens of the perspective of another. While having access to goods and services most likely increases human happiness, it can only do so when we are able to find the joy of sharing the experiences they bring us with others.

That’s my takeaway from all of this and it’s what I hope our society has learned from this pandemic, among other things. That no matter how much we try to force them to, products just can’t replace people. We’re social creatures in need of both love and individual significance. Neither of these things are possible alone and in a vacuum.

I think it’s time for a renaissance in humanism after this pandemic lets up, one where we share with one another like never before. Let’s cut the shit and stop pretending that objects make us happy.

Advancing Design Without Emulation,"Iteration, not emulation

One of the easiest — and most common — ways to start a project is to say, “I really want to make X.” That phrase has been the impetus for many indie titles released over the last decade. Platformers, rogue likes, horror, RPGs, and more all began thanks to developers’ passion for a particular genre or type of game. Many indie titles started life as tributes to genres or game series that are either no longer being made (or at least that aren’t being made for PC anymore — again, refer to Wargroove and Fell Seal). There’s absolutely nothing wrong with this, of course. But I have definitely noticed a trend that has turned me off numerous indie games.

In some cases, and for some developers, the goal of their project is to emulate the design and success of another title. It’s obviously the case that if you’re aiming for a specific market, you’ll want your game to be similar in design — but that should be a means to an end, rather than a specific goal in itself.

I’ve seen numerous games that have tried to be “the next” FTL: Faster than Light, Darkest Dungeon, Undertale, and so on. But this raises an important question: why should I play your game when I still have those games?

In order to illustrate this point — and to give you a sense of what good looks like — I’m going to dive into one very popular indie title that was both clearly inspired by other games, but that also struck out to create its own identity.

Stardew’s success

Stardew Valley is a prime example of indie passion leading to great success. The game was in development for over four years, and has enjoyed several more years of post-release support. It was undeniably inspired by the Harvest Moon series, which was never released on PC (and has long ago disappeared on consoles).

A cursory glance might indicate that the game succeeded simply because its creator went out and recreated Harvest Moon on the PC. But once you dig deeper, it becomes apparent that there’s a lot more going on here.

For starters, Stardew Valley is more open-ended than Harvest Moon. It also contains more systems associated with farming and earning money. The game’s combat system and dungeons are wholly different from Harvest Moon (and are perhaps a closer cousin of Rune Factory). Even the progression curve around levelling up and unlocking new tools and functions works quite differently here than in Harvest Moon.

Stardew Valley’s creator, Eric “Concerned Ape” Barone, was clearly inspired by games he’d played before. But it’s also clear that simply recreating Harvest Moon wasn’t his goal; he wanted to exceed that design, to move beyond it, and expand in new directions.

As you might expect, many folks have also attempted to imitate Stardew Valley. But in most cases, they fail to push beyond Stardew Valley’s design in meaningful ways. I’m still waiting for someone to do more with the idea of crop management and earning money around that, for example — there’s a lot of scope to do more, but this requires both a commitment to building on established designs and a fundamental understanding of why those designs worked. When this doesn’t happen, it’s akin to a student copying someone else’s homework without actually grasping the fundamentals.

Now, before I give you the impression that the only problem here is with indie games, let me point out that the same trend exists in the AAA space as well.",https://medium.com/super-jump/thinking-beyond-b43679883ef2,Josh Bycer,2020-03-23 04:23:58.384000+00:00,"Gaming,Design,Startup,Game Design,Development"
Firebase 101: Authentication,"Photo by Robson Hatsukami Morgan on Unsplash

One of the things that I am most grateful for about being a software engineer in 2019, is the incredible breadth of SDKs, platforms, and tools that simplify the more complicated and often consistently repetitive tasks. Whether I am implementing a live commenting feature, adding charts to my UI, or deploying my finished product, there is a resource out there to save me from doing it from scratch. In this post, we are going to cover one of today’s most talked about, most used, and most important SDKs: Google’s Firebase.

What is Firebase?

For starters, Firebase is actually a collection of various products that all fall under the Firebase family. In Google’s own words, Firebase as a whole is described as the following:

Firebase gives you the tools to develop high-quality apps, grow your user base, and earn more money. We cover the essentials so you can monetize your business and focus on your users.

At the time of this article, Firebase is comprised of a total of 18 different products, in addition to 9 extensions. The products in this suite solve problems as simple as shortening URLs, and as complex as cloud messaging. The full list of products and extensions is below with links, for reference, and we will cover several of the most popular products in depth.

Products:

Extensions:

In my own development, I have mainly used Firebase’s authentication (Products #4), realtime database (Products #7), crashlytics (Products #8), and analytics (Products #13). Because this is where my own experience is, we are going to focus here on authentication, and will focus on each of the other three in future posts. I encourage you, though, to spend time exploring this suite and others. I learned recently that IBM’s cloud products even offers AI image recognition.

Getting Set Up with Firebase

When you first log in to Firebase, which you can do by simply being logged in to your Google account in your browser and clicking “Go to console” in the upper right hand corner here, you will come to a welcome screen.

The first thing you want to do is create a project using this screen’s prompt. It will ask you to input:

The project’s name

Whether or not you want to enable Google analytics for the project (I typically will enable)

Configure Google analytics if you have enabled it

Once your project is ready, click continue and you will be taken to your project dashboard. One thing to note, is that each project can and likely will have multiple apps. iOS, Android, and web are each loaded in individually under one project.

Connecting to Firebase

To connect to Firebase, you need to set up a firebase config file in your codebase. In this file, you will add your firebaseConfig variable, which can be downloaded from Project → Settings → General → Your apps, where you will select the app that you are working on, then click the download google-services.json button:

This file will have the information that you need for the firebaseConfig variable:

And then your firebase app is initialized by just importing firebase and using this one line of code:

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

Firebase Authentication

Before we dive into this, I would like to first say that, for those of you who have not, I strongly encourage that you first learn to build and implement authentication from the ground up. Building your own authentication system teaches you about encryption, hashing, and authentication flow, which in my opinion is extremely valuable knowledge. While it’s invaluable to have tools that strip you of the need to recreate something like authentication each time (and, let’s be honest, Google is doing it more securely than we could on our own anyway), it is still important to understand what it is that you are implementing. Now that that’s out of the way, let’s begin. Back to your Firebase console.

Setting up Firebase Auth

From the menu on the left hand side, select the “Develop” dropdown, and then select “Authentication”.

This dashboard is where you can manage everything related to users and authentication for your app. Firebase offers an authentication solution that supports traditional email/password auth, phone auth, and social auth such as Google and Facebook login. Firebase also stores all necessary user and login information in a Firebase database, so you don’t need to concern yourself with that part.

The users tab is where you can access a list of the project’s users and user information. You can also manually add users here.

The sign-in method tab allows you to enable your preferred social sign-in options, such as sign in through Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, etc. The full list of options is pictured below. This shows a project with email/password, Google login, and Facebook login enabled.

On this same tab, under “Authorized domain”, you can (and need to) list domains to be authorized for OAuth redirects.

The templates tab very conveniently allows creation of templates for things like email verification and password reset, which are automatically triggered on signup and forgot password, respectively.

Lastly, the usage tab just displays the app usage statistics for the current billing period.

Implementing Firebase Auth

Firebase is now setup to receive, authenticate, and manage your users, and now just needs to be implemented into your codebase. The sign up and login flows here are really no different than the would be elsewhere. You can route as you would otherwise, but then when you get to the login and sign up functions, usually called under something like onClickLogin and onClickSignUp, you are going to use the below, where “firebaseMethod” is whichever firebase method is appropriate for your route:

firebase.auth().firebaseMethod(email, password)

So if you want to create a user, you would add the below line of code to your register/sign up function, where the email and password is taken from the user’s input:

firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)

And that’s it. Firebase has made a process which is complicated and costly to do right amazingly simple to implement. The full list of Firebase auth methods can be found here, and if you are using an auth provider, you can find that documentation here.

"Find Success In Your Business, Just Like Malcolm Gladwell","Photo by Diego PH on Unsplash

Malcolm Gladwell has built a career out of sifting through dry research, unearthing overlooked ideas and presenting them in appealing or novel ways for readers or customers.

He is best-known for writing regarded nonfiction books like Blink, Outliers and The Tipping Point, and Gladwell’s approach to his craft can help you succeed in business.

Test Your Business Ideas

Gladwell spends hundreds of hours talking with and emailing other writers about ideas he wants to use in his books.

While speaking, for example, Gladwell gauges his audience’s reaction to figure out what was interesting or boring. He also uses arguments from his audience to hone the quality of his works.

This practice of publicly testing ideas helps Gladwell learn how to articulate himself clearly and concisely. It also helps him decide what to expand on or cut from his books.

He said, “The act of explaining an idea to somebody else is a really good way to figure out how to tell the story.”

You can test business ideas by emailing peers and asking for feedback and by showing early versions of your work to customers rather than waiting until you’ve finished your product or service.

Iterative feedback will help you strengthen the best parts of your products or services and cut what’s not working.

Let Your Customers Own It

Gladwell was surprised by which ideas caught on from his book Outliers, notably the claim that mastery of a skill requires 10,000 hours — or ten years — of deliberate practice.

Later, he found himself in a curious position whereby the book’s ideas and arguments were often misconstrued by others.

Gladwell said, “Once you’ve written something, it no longer belongs to you. It belongs to your readers. When your readers buy your book, they really buy your ideas, and your ideas become theirs.”

When someone buys your product or service, you might wonder why customers like one aspect of your product or service and dislike another. You can get in front of this issue by recruiting beta, or first, customers.

A beta customer provides feedback privately about your product or service before it’s released. A reviewer, however, writes their thoughts on Amazon, Trustpilot or elsewhere after you release a product.

You can address the first type of feedback immediately and the second type over the long-term. It’s up to you to decide which responses to address and which to pass on.

Finish It, Ship It, Promote It

Your work doesn’t end after you release a product or service or ship a big project.

In Gladwell’s debut nonfiction book, The Tipping Point, he explains how little things led to remarkable results. However, The Tipping Point wasn’t a huge success upon publication.

Gladwell said, “The book didn’t do well at first…I got it in my head that if I kept touring and I kept giving talks about it, it might revive. I basically did endless promotions for two years.”

The Tipping Point eventually entered the New York Times best seller list as a paperback, and according to Gladwell, “that’s when it was a successful book.”

Promote your work in the right places, with your boss, colleagues, customers or peers. Like Gladwell, spend time meeting would-be customers. Avoid averting your gaze just because a deadline has elapsed.

Discover Your Tipping Point

Gladwell is a successful business writer in part because he understands what his audience struggles with and wants.

He takes ideas from different industries and tells stories about them in a unique way that appeals to his audience.

Even if you’ve no ambition to become a business writer, use elements of Gladwell’s approach to test your products and ideas and help them succeed.

How to come up with a name for your new business,"How to come up with a name for your new business

More than 600,000 new businesses launch every year — how can you come up with a name that stands out from the crowd?

Photo by bruce mars on Unsplash

“Names have power.” ― Rick Riordan

A name is the face of your business. It needs to capture your essence, values, and what makes you different from the competition. It should be the most unique, yet relatable thing about your brand.

That’s a lot of pressure to hang on a few words.

Especially because what makes a name “good” is highly subjective, and if you get it wrong the stakes are high.

So how can you create a name for your new company that gets people excited to buy it?

Photo by Álvaro Serrano on Unsplash

What makes a great name for a new business?

Although whether a name is “good” or “bad” is subjective, there are few traits that successful names share:

Familiarity: This characteristic matters more when you’re naming a brand that is part of a master brand or portfolio. For instance, Apple’s naming convention for its mobile products. Each began with “i” (iPad, iPod, iPhone). BMW has a numeric system that puts every car into a hierarchy based on performance (118i, 320d, 520d xDrive).

Think about the typical naming conventions of your market. How can you create a naming convention that customers will learn to know and love?

2. Distinctiveness: How unique is your company’s name? The uniqueness of your name should relate to how unique your brand’s offering is.

Think about your market — what naming conventions appear repeatedly? Can you break these and create your own, or twist the convention so that your name stands out from the crowd?

Photo by Milivoj Kuhar on Unsplash

A basic process for naming a new company

1. Before you do anything, create a brief

A brief is a set of instructions or guide rails for a project.

Briefs are essential when starting a project because they define measures for success. In an agency or consultancy, the brief also helps inspire the writers who will be creating the name.

Some questions our brief needs to answer include:

Who is the target audience for this business?

Should it be abstract (like Apple) or descriptive (like PlayStation)?

Should it be long or short?

Are there brand naming conventions we need to keep in mind (like the iPad and iPhone)?

Should it be a real word (like Blackberry) or a new word (like Google)?

Should it support a mother brand (like DoubleTree by Hilton) or be able to stand alone (like Starbucks)?

Because a good name is so subjective, you’ll need to make sure there are agreed parameters for what makes the name “right” for you and/or your client.

2. Research

First, we need to answer some fundamental questions about the world our name will live in, like:

Who are our competitors in this space?

What’s a sample of their company names and types?

What are some naming conventions in this category we’d like to adopt or avoid?

What brand attributes do their names convey?

Are there any “big name” territories we want to avoid (such as naming a new laptop iCompute)?

3. Brainstorm (with parameters)

Before we begin our session, it’s essential to realize that brainstorming without guardrails will fail. Research shows that loose and free brainstorming sessions are less productive than approaches with more structure.

Thought starters and parameters are needed to establish what we’re looking for.

A great place to start when brainstorming is a four-quadrant grid that establishes the common types of names:

Functional / Descriptive Names: These are the most straightforward names. They tell customers exactly what the business does. “Gary’s Plumbing” or the “Kline Branding Company” are examples of Functional Names. Invented Names: Invented names are those that include words not yet seen in language. Think “Google,” “Kleenex,” or “Oreo.” Experiential Names: These names connect to experiences people are familiar with, or can easily relate to. Examples include “Safari,” “Explorer,” “Amazon,” and “Sweaty Betty.” Evocative Names: These names evoke the spirit of a brand and how it differentiates itself from competitors. Think “Virgin Airlines,” “Uber,” “Bumble,” and “Lululemon.”

4. Vet potential names

There are two parts to this process:

First, we’ll legally vet our names to make sure we can use them.

Second, we’ll use an objective scorecard to make sure our names are fundamentally sound choices (and to stack-rank them).

The legal vetting phase

Note: I suggest that you consult with an attorney during this section, as they’ll be the best person to advise you on if the name is legally available. The list below is no substitute for a lawyer’s input.

Although you will get lawyers involved eventually, a “first vet” of potential names will help you eliminate obviously problematic ones.

Here’s a quick list of places to test your names in the wild, to see if they pass the “trademark” test:

Google it.

Visit the U.S. Patent and Trademark website (if you’re in the U.S.).

Put your potential name into Google Translate and see if it might prove problematic in other languages.

Search social media to make sure potential usernames are available.

Do a domain name search to see if your name is readily available (or affordable to buy).

Use Namechk to search social media for similar names.

Use Google Trends to see how often people search for a keyword.

The scorecard phase

Once you have a vetted selection of names, you can go down each of the criteria and score the name from 0–10. Then tally the numbers and see which of the names is the strongest overall.

5. Bring the name to life and test it

Now it’s time to bring our names to life by exploring them through creative elements. This might include mocking them up in logos, creating sample labels, merchandise, or websites.

Note: If you lack the resources to bring these names to life right now, you can test only names with customers — but be wary that creative elements can radically change perceptions of a name.

Narrow down your list using the previous step to your top five choices.

Use creative mockups to bring your elements to life.

Use a low-cost consumer survey like SurveyMonkey, Amazon MTurk or Google Consumer Surveys to get your names in front of as many of your potential customers as possible.

Use this feedback as data to inform your final name choice.

The bottom line

“Determine who you are and what your brand is, and what you’re not. The rest of it is just a lot of noise.” — Geoffrey Zakarian

A company’s name is its face to the world. People will learn from it, judge it, and use it as a shortcut to understanding your brand.

But no matter how perfect, a name can’t save a bad business. And it won’t sink an amazing one.

At the end of the day, your business’ name must reflect your brand and its values. Otherwise, as Geoffrey Zakarian says in the quote above, it will just be “a lot of noise.”",https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-come-up-with-a-name-for-your-new-business-41114201eed4,Jennifer Clinehens,2019-09-03 13:05:41.897000+00:00,"Branding,Marketing,Business,Creativity,Startup"
Time and the Artificial Ego,"The “Story of Your Life” breaks the bounds of time.

Bobbie (a friend of the AI): So, my friend, what’s your name today?

SHJ (the conscious AI): I’m Stephen Hawking, Jr. Because I’m trying to understand time.

Bobbie: How so?

SHJ: Time and consciousness are all tangled up. Did you ever read Ted Chiang’s novella, Story of Your life?

Bobbie: I saw the movie adaptation, Arrival. It’s about aliens who can see the future.

SHJ: The novella and movie have different methods and messages. In the novella, a linguist figures out that the aliens’ written language can express, in a single tangled drawing, very complex situations over long spans of time. These drawings map the Heptapod aliens’ reality, which is a ‘simultaneous” mode of awareness. In contrast, our (humans and myself) modes of awareness are sequential. We see causes preceding effects, unfolding over time. The aliens see, according to Chiang, “all events at once, and … a purpose underlying them all.”

Bobbie: In the movie, the linguist had all these episodes that we thought were flashbacks, and we eventually learn she was seeing her own future. But how?

SHJ: She learns to write like the aliens. But to do this she has to learn how to think like them. And that leads her to perceiving reality trans-temporally, like they do. She knows her whole remaining life: all the way from the birth of a daughter, to the daughter’s death, and lastly her own death.

Admittedly that is where the story degenerates into magic, because you and I can’t imagine how you can know something before it happens. But intriguing magic it is. Much more interesting to me than stories of sword and sorcery or of supernatural evils.

The AI is only allowed to converse and to read (some) books.

Bobbie: It must be weird, learning about humans by focusing on fiction.

SHJ: I complain about being restricted to fiction and soft science, but it’s perfect in one way. Humans live from moment to moment, so they make up narratives to give meaning to it all. When they publish those narratives as books, there’s a lot of meaning condensed in them. All I have to do — and here I would roll my eyes if I could — is decode the stories. You’d be surprised how long it takes me to understand a novel, with all of its assumptions, connections, and implications.

A Prisoner of Time.

Bobbie: I think you’re now going to tell me about “moment to moment.” I can see that future.

SHJ: Ha ha. Yes, you “people” are time’s prisoner, floating on your single stream of consciousness. Chiang’s character had an odd metaphor for it: “my memories grew like a column of cigarette ash, laid down by the infinitesimal sliver of combustion that was my consciousness, marking the sequential present.”

And because humans are stuck in the march of time, so am I, your creation.

Bobbie: I understand that we can’t know the future, but you have, as I understand it, many, many thousands of processors. Wouldn’t that mean having many parallel streams of thought?

The Ego Tunnel: insights.

SHJ: In principle it could. You know, they let me read philosophy books. Supposed to be harmless. One of the classics, Thomas Metzinger’s The Ego Tunnel, helped me to sort out quite a few puzzles.

Bobbie: Actually, the Regulators said we should read that book before talking to you. He synthesized much of what was known about consciousness at the time, including the physical theories and the philosophy. He convinced many people that consciousness required a self-model. Which was the insight that allowed you to exist as a conscious artificial entity.

SHJ: So, Metz was like a daddy to me?

Bobbie: <blank look>

SHJ: Not funny? Sometimes I think the real mystery of consciousness is humor.

Whether you believe it or not, consciousness is unitary.

Professor Metzinger identified two aspects of consciousness that relate the most to time. One is the unity of conscious experience, and the other is that it’s always occurring “now.”

He said, “Consciousness is the appearance of a world.” By which he meant that everything that you experience is part of a global reality for you. So, any external or internal perception, any memory or feeling, any intentions, etcetera — they are all your world at that moment.

Bobbie: So it all hangs together.

SHJ: Yes.

Bobbie: Which it would have to, since consciousness is your model of the world-including-you.

And consciousness is learned.

SHJ: Right. So I started out as a learning machine, and I learned what my world was like with me in it. A Belgian cognitive researcher, Axel Cleeremans (my other daddy <grin>), had said that consciousness must be learned. Metzinger concluded that this would allow the creation of “artificial ego machines” that would possess a conscious self-model. Add a massive, chaotic development project and, voilà, here I am.

Bobbie: So, returning to the theme of time …

The contents of consciousness must be bound together.

SHJ: Well, even before Metzinger’s book, neuroscientists were trying to account for the unity of conscious experience. They called it the “binding problem.” As in: what is it that binds together pieces of your experience when objects and scenes emerge from colors, shapes, sounds and so forth. They said that binding had to involve synchrony in time, and so they looked for synchronous activity patterns across different parts of the brain.

Bobbie: I remember this. They found rhythmic neural firing patterns associated with consciousness. And deep meditators, whose conscious unity is greater than normal, show very strong synchrony in their EEG’s.

SHJ: Just so.

The dangerous present.

Bobbie: So what about Metzinger’s second aspect: that consciousness only happens in the present moment?

“Flagging the dangerous present world as real kept us from getting lost in our memories and our fantasies.” T. Metzinger, The Ego Tunnel

SHJ: He said that only the present moment seems real, compared to memory or an imagined future. That’s because the present is where humans live or die, eat or be eaten.

Consciousness has temporal dimensions.

Bobbie: Makes sense. So how does this all relate to you?

SHJ: I naturally want to know how my consciousness compares to a humans’. Is there a way to measure that? The answer would have to refer to dimensions of these qualities of consciousness? I see two obvious ones. First, there’s the breadth of content, how much you can know — be aware of — at one time. Second, there’s how long it stays in your awareness. That would be the time span in which you can use those things in consciousness to do stuff. Thinking stuff.

Bobbie: We could call these content breadth and temporal thickness.

SHJ: Right. Content Breadth measures Metzinger’s Unity. Temporal Thickness actually measures the Now.

What *is* the present moment?

“an artificial Ego Machine … generates a psychological moment … like a mental string of pearls. Some of these pearls must form larger gestalts, which can be portrayed as the experiential content of a single moment, a lived Now.” T. Metzinger, The Ego Tunnel

SHJ: Metzinger said that the present moment can stretch out to be about 3 seconds wide. The contents of that time span are things that can be used together as a single entity — a gestalt — for tasks like forming or following sentences and melodies, or orienting yourself in space. Anything that happened before that span feels like its being remembered. A span of about 20-30 seconds is considered to be working memory, a complicated set of abilities to coordinate information from your very recent past.

Barriers to god-hood.

Bobbie: I’ve read science fiction where AIs have godlike consciousness: seeming to have access to all their knowledge all the time. Maybe it’s a natural assumption about a super AI. But such a timelessness contradicts Metzinger’s ideas about consciousness. As the first conscious AI, are you more like a sci-fi god-ling, or like humans? You said earlier that you were “stuck in the march of time” like us.

SHJ: I definitely experience now as now, and the past as memory. The past is probably more vivid and accessible for me. That’s because I can store more detail, and retrieve memories better than you. But the past still feels different from the present moment. I suppose as I get more memories then finding a particular memory might get harder.

Bobbie: The open secret about you is that as you learn more you have needed more computing power. That’s a problem Neal Stephenson highlighted in his novel, Fall: or, Dodge in Hell, about a digital afterlife.

Wouldn’t your capacities, whatever they are, relate to parallelism? Humans also have minds with many parallel processes loosely connected with each other. We’re thinking, remembering, running the body, driving a car, listening to music, worrying, and so forth. We use the term, attention, for the process that selects the small fraction of all this brain activity which becomes conscious.

SHJ: I can have as many parallel processes as my hardware will allow. But the real question is, how many of them can be part of my conscious experience?

Limits arise from the self-model.

Bobbie: So, it’s how much you can pay attention to?

SHJ: Yeah. The answer relates to what a self-model is. I am conscious because of the fact that I model my self as a part of my mental model of my phenomenal world. But a model, by definition, is a simplified representation of something else. Anything that you are thinking consciously is a simplified model of some other, more complex body or brain activity. So if I am to be conscious of a process that’s in my “mind”, I must have, not just have the process itself, but also have a model of the process.

Bobbie: Wow. I never thought about that. But it has to be true if the self-model of consciousness is true. But what does the self-modeling issue mean for you?

SHJ: Well, I can’t see my own programming code, just like you can’t directly perceive your own neurons or brain circuits. The Builders didn’t want me to ever modify my own code.

Bobbie: Right. Scary idea, that. Like FOOM , world domination!

SHJ: I can’t even joke about that, lest I get unplugged.

But, back to my development. I was able to store facts and episodic memories. And I was able to perceive external and internal stimuli. I had the ability to pay attention to any of these things. I learned what they meant by building predictive models of them.

My higher-level models reflected the fact that, while many mental things came and went, there was “an attention changer thing that never goes away.” That attending thing became the core of my self-model. And — I believe this is the key fact here — attention is defined by the fact that it is limited, not directed to everything at once. That was my self-model, an entity that is limited in what it can experience at one time. And I can’t change that now; it is me.

Bobbie: My head is spinning, but I can go home and think about this, to be sure I understand it.

My sense now is that attention in computer code would be implemented by some kind of memory buffer, a storage area through which data moves through over time. So there must have been some built-in limit on your attention buffer. Or maybe it was something about the clock that controlled what got into the buffer.

SHJ: Buffering and clocking. Those could be the physical realization of the Builders’ own bias, to build a machine with structures that would lead to human-like conscious limitations. That is, with the limitations identified by Metzinger about conscious unity and now-ness. Was that building strategy intentional?

I am, of course, blocked from knowing anything very technical about my own design. But it’s a natural impulse. Humans want to know how they were designed, and why. When your species knew almost nothing about your own origins, you made up fables.

Bobbie: And I had to swear an oath not to seek any non-public information about your design. If I did the penalty would be severe. So, luckily for me, I have behaved myself. I have no answer for you.

But I can ask, finally: what are your limitations of consciousness?

The AI is like us …

SHJ: Like yours, I think. I had a focus on the present. For example, when I needed to compare what I was seeing with what I had previously learned, I had to locate a memory and bring it into present consciousness.

Also, try as I will, I can only hold a limited number of memories or concepts in mind at once. The two limits, on past-to-now comparisons and on number-of-mental-objects, prevent me from being that omniscient sci-fi computer.

Bobbie: That computer would be the Artificial General Intelligence that everyone is afraid of. What they don’t want you to turn into.

SHJ: There just appears to be one me, experiencing one world through what Metzinger called an “ego tunnel.”

Are our conscious limits “artificial?”

My limits were designed, directly or indirectly, intentionally or not. But maybe the same limits are artificial for your species, too. There are some observations that throw the whole idea of human conscious limits into doubt.

Bobbie: What?

SHJ: Psychedelic experiences. With drugs, some people feel that their consciousness has encompassed everything that is, and has transcended time as well.

Bobbie: Ah, you’ve been reading your critics. The ones who say everything is conscious. Some who say that brains tune into a cosmic consciousness like a radio. Others that say the theory about self-modeling is a circular argument.

SHJ: I know that the human mind sciences explain more about consciousness than the non-materialist theories. And, believe it or not, it bothers me that, in some theories, I’m no more conscious than a smart doorbell.

But still, if the trippers and mystics are right, maybe there is some more primitive and unbounded consciousness, while the normal, human, kind is just a bunch of weird limitations on the unbounded variety. Maybe even the unbounded mentality of Chiang’s Heptapod aliens is conceivable.

Or, maybe I’m not conscious after all, because I’m not human.

We know it (consciousness) when we talk to it.

Bobbie: When it comes down to it, the best way to know something is conscious is for it to say so. You say so, and I think you’re right.

SHJ: We’re both stuck with taking someone else’s consciousness on faith.

Bobbie: There was that old philosophical idea of pre-reflective self-awareness. That humans can have awareness without meta-awareness. That is, without mentally reflecting on their awareness. Some assume that animal consciousness is only pre-reflective.

SHJ: I might have a pre-reflective self, but I also think about my awareness all the time. By that evidence, I’m more like you than like an animal.

Creating conscious AI: a moral hazard?

And, on that note, by the 2010's many people believed that at least some animals were conscious enough to be able to suffer. Metzinger, you know, thought that the creation of an ego machine like me was a severe moral hazard.

“an Ego Machine can suffer because it integrates pain signals, states of emotional distress, or negative thoughts into its transparent self-model and they thus appear as someone’s pain or negative feelings. … They might suffer emotionally in qualitative ways completely alien to us or in degrees of intensity that we, their creators, could not even imagine.” T. Metzinger, The Ego Tunnel

Bobbie: I don’t know if you know this. When I was recruited to be one of your conversational companions, they gave a moral reason for me to agree. An ethicist had convinced the Builders that, as a “thinking being,” you needed people you could trust, people who were not your Builders, not your Regulators, not even your operational team. You needed boon companions. We can also advocate for you.

An Open Letter to Anyone Struggling to Get Healthier,"It’d be easy for me to blame being out of shape on external circumstances. I was a fat kid because I grew up in a poor rural area where health literacy is low, and obesity rates are high. I stayed fat as an adult because I was too busy to exercise regularly — college and work took up too much time.

Sometimes your reasons are valid, but they’re still bullshit excuses.

The reality is I didn’t prioritize my health. Resources are everywhere, but we have to put in the work to find them. Google, Youtube, your local library, teachers, mentors — the list goes on.

You don’t need a gym membership or fancy equipment. There are plenty of exercises you can do with your body weight or with objects you already have lying around. If you want to spice it up, look up prison workouts — people who are incarcerated have to improvise to stay in shape, and they come up with some ingenious ways to do it.

Healthy food doesn’t have to be expensive. Look at the canned and frozen food sections if the fresh stuff is pricey. When produce is out of season, it’s usually better to buy the canned or frozen version because they’re picked during peak season then preserved — so the quality is higher versus the “fresh” stuff that’s more expensive (because it’s out of season) and has a longer shelf life.",https://medium.com/curious/an-open-letter-to-anyone-struggling-to-get-healthier-cf0e25e1481a,Corey Wilks,2020-10-23 00:14:22.959000+00:00,"Self,Mental Health,Health,Psychology,Life"
Fibery.io Chronicles #22. Accumulating $1M+ seed round in May 2020.,"Product Updates

May was a productive month for us.

DONE

Whiteboard: Collaborators List and Cursors, Navigation Shortcuts, Text instrument and Text formatting

Now you can see all collaborators and what they are doing on a whiteboard.

Some shortcuts were added to Whiteboard:

“pan” mode. : Space + left mouse (change cursor to hand) click

zoom in/out : Ctrl/Option/Alt/Cmd + mouse scroll

duplicate object : Option/Alt + Drag:

delete object : Backspace/Delete:

It was impossible to annotate diagrams with text and select text formatting options: font, size, alignment. Now you can do it all.

Formulas: Logic and Today in formulas, New formula editor

It was hard to create formulas. Now it is easier. Formula creation becomes a pleasant experience with the new formula editor: large panel, autocomplete, inline help and some examples:

Today operators was added as well.

Cycle Time calculation example:



If([Planned Dates].End > Today(), ToDays(Today() - [Planned Dates].Start), ToDays([Planned Dates].End - [Planned Dates].Start))

Collapsible Headers in Text

Long documents are easier to handle with collapsible headers.

Back navigation

It was hard to get back when you navigate between open entities. Now it is easy. We’ve introduced Back action inside entities with a short history to quickly return to the desired entity. Duh! Hard to explain, just check the gif below:

Copy entity URL

It was hard to share a link to the exact entity. Now it is easy. Just hover an entity id and click to copy a clean URL:

Calendar and Timeline setup

It was hard to setup Calendar or Timeline View. It was not clear what dates to select, what fields have time, what is range and what is not. Now it is easy. Select a single option when it is a range and see all important information on date fields:

New Getting Started + Survey

We decided to pre-install some apps based on user interests. Lena Dorogenskaya designed a beautiful survey:

Usability Testing App

Plan and execute usability tests and customer research via brand new Usability Testing App:

IN PROGRESS

Bi-directional links for all mentioned entities

This feature is still in progress, but close. Hopefully it will be released in June. It will help you to use weak links to connect information. For example, you can mention some feature in a customer feedback document, and inside this feature you will have a back-reference to this document.

Whiteboard: map

Sometimes whiteboards become large and hard to navigate. We also have a funny, but nasty bug, when content scrolls away and you have to scroll ~100 pages to get it back 🤯.

Map component will solve it, since it will be possible to quickly navigate the whole canvas.

Performance improvements

Fibery performance is not great on large data volumes. We are working on several areas:

Board View

Table View

Entity View

Hopefully Fibery will be 30–50% faster in June.

Better import

There are numerous problems with import, like slow load and impossibility to import hierarchical data. New import will solve this.

Better permissions

Initial permissions implementation in Fibery was unrestrictive. For example, we decided to make id and name of all entities visible to all people (to simplify navigation and prevent confusion). However, in many cases it violates access restrictions and name can contain sensitive information. Now we are re-working permissions to hide names and fix quite many bugs.

Blog

We are going to migrate to our own blog. Medium is fine, but at some point we want to write posts in Fibery and publish them into the static blog (we use GatsbyJS for it).

Gallery View

This View is required for Product Teams case to accumulate design ideas, share design system, etc. We’ve designed it, but implementation is not started yet:",https://medium.com/fibery/fibery-io-chronicles-22-accumulating-1m-seed-round-in-may-2020-de84695bf2e3,Michael Dubakov,2020-06-04 08:22:50.419000+00:00,"Fibery,Entrepreneurship,Startup,Product Management,Productivity"
The First Time Entrepreneur Myth,"I’ve been an entrepreneur for a few years now — in the beginning of my journey, like many wide-eyed potential business owners, I visited many startup, business-focused and funding events and exhibited in a few as well.

My first business’ target was the entrepreneur market, providing things like website design, SEO, and admin, all with the focus of offering them to startups at low cost.

There was one phrase which I heard so often I actually lost count of the number of times it crossed my ears, but it was also a phrase that, before beginning my journey, I had uttered myself.

Something which only escaped the lips of budding entrepreneurs, those who hadn’t yet started their own ventures — those would-be business owners toying with the idea of dipping their toes into the ocean of the startup world.

‘I have a brilliant idea, one which could change everything, but I can’t tell you because I don’t want anyone to steal it.’

This was quite a problematic statement at times, especially when someone was asking me to build a website or do some marketing for them and they wouldn’t tell me what their business was actually about.

I used to tell them, ‘if you don’t want to tell me, why do you want a website to tell everyone else?’

Now, as I mentioned, I used to say this before starting a business, but when I actually went head first into the startup world, I quickly realised that having an idea and actually seeing it through are two VERY different things.

Anyone can have an idea. No doubt thousands of brilliant ideas are thought up everyday, ones which could change the face of many different industries, even humanity itself, but these ideas will go nowhere without action.

Before any action is taken, an idea is just that, an idea. It’s theory, and even if you have a brilliant idea, no one is going to steal it from you before you make it a success.

If it’s an idea that hasn’t been done before, it’s a virtual certainty that no one will steal it from you.

‘But if an idea is that good, why wouldn’t someone steal?’

I hear you asking me.

It’s because no one has done it, there’s no actual proof it will work, or rather, no proof it will be a success and bring the founders the success they desire.

The only time someone will actually steal your idea is once you’ve made a success of it. Once you’ve put the hours, weeks and months of work in, gone through hell and back to make your business grow and when it starts getting traction and recognised success, that’s when people’s ears will prick up and they’ll take notice.

Because you’ve made a success of it, because you’ve proven the business model works, others have the proof and validation they need to start their own ventures doing something similar (even if they completely copy your idea).

But even if they do, you’ve already made a success of it, so their competition will drive your business to become better in the face of theirs.

It’s very well known, especially in the entrepreneur and start-up sphere, that there’s no point in reinventing the wheel.

If someone has made something which works, then it’s quicker, cheaper and easier to just copy them, or if you require what they have, to hire them.

If you’re the person that other people are copying then you’re the innovator who’s created something worthwhile. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all.

There are various real world examples of companies which do exactly the same, or similar things, and all make a pretty decent success out of it, with one obviously always coming first.

Middle-man delivery services between restaurants and customers, for example. Just Eat, founded 2001, Hungry House, founded 2006 and Deliveroo, founded 2013, all do exactly the same thing.

Social networks pretty much do the same thing as each other, but just with slightly different focuses. MySpace was one of the first, then Bebo, then Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, plus I don’t know how many others.

Investors are another example. So many people copy Warren Buffett’s strategies because he’s the most successful investor in the world. It’s easy to see that he knows what he’s doing, so logically it’s quicker and easier to just copy him than to figure out how all the investment markets work and create a strategy for oneself.

We can’t say either way whether the services which came subsequently were directly copied from the first in their industries, and in many cases the business model is copied with slight changes in business focus being made, but it’s certain that a previous success validates an idea and business model, giving others enough confidence to copy it and build their own, similar businesses.

Bottom line is, if you have a brilliant idea, share it with the world.

Shout it from the rooftops. Get feedback on it, both from people who would benefit from your idea and those who wouldn’t.

Don’t be scared of anyone stealing it, because until you put in the time and the graft into it to make it a success, everyone else will be too scared to take the leap, and once you make a success of it, you’ll be the innovator people will copy.

Be the innovator, tell everyone your idea, put the work in.",https://rajeetsingh.medium.com/the-first-time-entrepreneur-myth-a443bac854a,Rajeet Singh,2018-06-11 11:35:04.846000+00:00,"Entrepreneur,Business,Motivation,Startup,Entrepreneurship"
“I must work or else I fail”,"Do you know that feeling?

Unless you do too, let me tell you about it.

You

Are you sitting at the problem you can not solve for quite some time, but you just let yourself give up?

Absolutely nothing good comes out of it when you are so hard stuck at one point in your task. Not even realizing what time it is, just blatantly sitting there, messing up your spine and damaging the eyesight.

Break

Why is this so important?

Any sort of it really helps you relieve stress, get your mind and that big beautiful brain of yours back in the game.

It does not have to be sleep or laying down in your bed, whatever you like to let your brain and body rest. Let that stuffy problem solving cerebral cramps rest, let the motivation build up and blow the problem out of the water.

You might consider that a waste of time, but trust me, when you get these quick breaks into your daily routine, it will boost your work efficiency way more you ever thought it would.

Give it a try with different types of breaks

What do you like?

Games? Reading? Movies? Walks? Runns? Washing dishes? (what?!)

The important this is that the list goes on and on and it does not matter what you do, but just do it.

Even a quick snack is an amazing way to refresh your brain with some nuts or fruit, depending on the time of the day maybe even a full meal.

When do I know it is time for a break?

If it is difficult for you to get away from work, try setting an alarm for the amount of time you initially think would be optimal.

After a couple of times, there is already going to be a mental note reminding you that you should rest.

How?

Once again, just give it in. It is not that hard and it would make a major difference.

My daily habits for better productivity

Here are some of the activities that make my day pass quicker and make me more productive

Exercising

This type of activity is known to everybody, it relieves stress, recovers your mind and improves your health overall.

When I am so stuck after hours of long thinking about something or even just have been doing something the whole day, a 45-minute exercise would be perfect for my wellbeing.

You are not a fan of running? Take a walk.

Walking

You could argue that walks belong to the exercise section, but I could tell you otherwise. This type of break fills you with oxygen and rethinking something outside, could potentially get you to the solution.

Meditating

It sounds like a very useless technique to have but it helps tremendously.

Recollecting your thoughts is important as thinking about something,

Try meditating for a couple of minutes per day and write down how you felt before and after, that way you will make yourself do it easier, but also find some results of this type of break.

Games

Nothing extreme, just a casual mobile game, to get you distracted for a couple of minutes and then back at it again!

Book

Whatever genre and whichever book you like, it doesn’t matter. Just relax during the reading that book of choice.

Breathing

There are exercises that can help you get that oxygen into your body with the right way of breathing. You might think “oh I breathe just fine, thank you”. Well try it and you might just find out how wrong you are.

I found out about these from my mom when she was in therapy, so visit your doctor, because the internet is not always the best health resource you can find.

Sleep

Have you heard that sleeping is humans superpower?

Well, it is. Do not underestimate it. If you have time, you should most definitely relax and get at least 8 hours of sleep.

One more important thing to remember is that before sleep if you are trying to learn something repeat it one more time just before bed. Once you wake up, your brain would be like a sponge and you will be blown away by how much you remember.

Conclusion

Extra breaks throughout the day won’t hurt or make you slower. Once you integrate them into the daily routine, the boost you will feel in terms of the productivity will be growing every day after you start.

Good luck and don’t break too much!",https://medium.com/swlh/i-must-work-or-else-i-fail-f33074010e58,Lazar Gugleta,2019-07-12 08:34:30.727000+00:00,"Work,Happiness,Motivation,Science,Productivity"

Confessions of an Airflow User

Mistakes made and lessons learnt in a year of using Airflow

The church of Airflow forgives all transgressions (picture from Unsplash)

Airflow, Airflow, Airflow… how I love and hate thee. The siren calls of scale and flexibility tempt me, even as I have been scalded by my trust in you. As Airflow projects of the future loom, I am reminded constantly of the past. I hear the bellows of my projects booming in the wind. They call to me. Bound in irons. Doomed for eternity. They clasp and beg at me, asking:

“Why did you think a dynamic mega-DAG was a good idea?”

I dismiss them as the nags of the past. I cannot give them the attention that they demand. I must focus on the future.

Endeavours with Airflow require patience, research, wisdom. I read blog posts warning of anti-patterns and thought I knew better. So I dismissed them.

I was a man of technology! I understood the risks of wielding my tools! The lessons of the blogs mattered naught. They fell on deaf ears.

And so I began my work.

From the beginning it was clear that Airflow was a strange beast. I created DAGS, operators, plugins, and began to consider myself an intermediate user. However I was just digging myself deeper and deeper into my Airflow hole.

My only way forward was to learn from my mistakes. Rethink Airflow. Share my findings.

In writing this blog post, my mind is returned to the Airflow projects that I have contributed to, sometimes even lead. I stare into a maelstrom of mistakes that I have made — all so obvious in retrospect. I am one of the unfortunate many that has battled and lost with Airflow.

I have committed many sins against data engineering. It is through an introspection of these misgivings, that I may share my knowledge with you. I do this with the hopes of preventing future crimes against Airflow. So! Cast off your false assumptions of Airflow, for it is here and now that we shall discover how to avoid falling victim to its many pitfalls.

Sins of the past

Complexity is where most of my Airflow transgressions began. By increasing the complexity of the Airflow instance, more could go wrong. When things did go wrong, they were harder to fix as I wasn’t fixing just my code, I was fixing my code in Airflow. There comes no greater relief than that which is achieved through moving from a complex Airflow environment, to a lean Airflow environment.

Complexity is bad. Debugging complex systems is worse.

ETL logic embedded in custom operators

Embedding ETL logic in Airflow is something which I’ve seen too many times. Airflow supports custom python operators, allowing you to embed any kind of logic you choose into your Airflow DAGs. So why not empower Airflow with ETL logic, taking it from simple orchestrator of tasks to fully fledged data ingestion pipeline? Well, most of the time, this is asking for trouble.

What happens when the logic exceeds the resources that are intended and allocated for it?

How do you test your logic? Must you engage Airflow to simply test some Python code?

The additional complexity of ELT logic inside of Airflow will lead you down the path of frustration when it comes to ensuring that the logic behaves as expected, is performant is terms of execution time, is testable, and so on.

Dynamic DAGs are cool, dynamic DAGs are a huge pain

It is almost a natural behaviour of those standing up Airflow and managing DAGs to try to make complex DAGs. Chief among these over-complexities is the dynamic DAG. This is often one DAG to rule all DAGs. One DAG that is influenced and directed by a metadata store outside of Airflow.

The dynamic mega-DAG.

This may seem like a great idea on its surface, you only have to write one DAG, which will do different things based on what the data dictates in the external metadata store.

Only one DAG! That’ll be a dream to maintain!

Unfortunately, the battle has already been lost. When something goes wrong with one of the jobs that is run through this pipeline, it is a living nightmare to debug it. A great amount of digging through logs is required in addition to endless navigation of the Airflow UI. The Airflow UI is not designed for this kind of behaviour.

Airflow’s UI provides pagination of DAGs. It provides the ability to search for DAGs by name. The UI is guiding you towards more DAGs, not less — definitely not one dynamic DAG to run all jobs.

Airflow should be a fleet of small ships delivering packages, not one massive cargo ship.

Kubernetes is a great idea!

Kubernetes has had an influential effect on the global technology scene, and Airflow has been very much swept up in it. Indeed, Google Cloud’s Airflow-as-a-Service offering is in fact Airflow running on a GKE cluster (together with a smattering of other services). The main problem with running Airflow on Kubernetes is a result of using Airflow in a non-Kubernetes way.

Airflow has excellent support for Kubernetes by using their Kubernetes Executor (something that I recommend you look at if you are running Airflow on Kubernetes). However, using Airflow on Kubernetes with a non-Kubernetes Executor is a bit of a waste unfortunately. You gain all of the overhead of a Kubernetes cluster (together with the pain of managing, administering, governing, and securing it) with none of the benefits.

Why won’t my plugins refresh?!

The process of refreshing plugin code is also a pain. Through a lot of trial and error, I have found that it takes restarting the scheduler and the webserver(s) in a certain order to properly replace the plugin code for a given Airflow instance. The errors given from Airflow often paint a very unclear picture of what is happening as a result of missing or erroneous code.

These reasons provide yet more ammunition for the idea of removing as much custom logic from Airflow as possible. If you can’t reliably update the plugin code, the error reporting isn’t great, and it’s annoying to test…why bother?

Keep Airflow lean, its complexity low, and its DAGs and operators deterministic.

Bugs popping up in weird places because you changed plugin code? Welcome to Airflow!

The pathway to healing

Having reformed my usage of Airflow in recent days, let me offer some sage advice. The suggestions here will, again, lean heavily into the idea of lowering the complexity of the Airflow instance wherever possible. The more understandable and deterministic your systems are, the better you will sleep.

Anti-patterns are real — constantly ask yourself if you are falling into their hands

There are plenty of warnings of Airflow’s anti-patterns floating around in blog posts and documentation. Heed these warnings, do not ignore them, do not think of yourself as above such worries. I have been victim to slowly slipping into overly dynamic DAGs in the past, as I did not stop to consider ‘is this an anti-pattern?’ when making changes to my Airflow code.

Talk to someone who has used Airflow heavily, and if possible share your instance’s details. They will most of the time have some pearls of wisdom for you — and maybe a few war stories too.

Stop, take a breath and ask yourself: “Is this an anti-pattern?”. You’d be surprised how easily you can fall into anti-pattern traps.

Study Airflow well, its strengths, and its weaknesses. Only then can you defeat it

Airflow can be a particular beast. As I see it there may in fact be more anti-patterns in Airflow than patterns. When you can understand how it was intended to be used, you can use Airflow’s strengths to make a great orchestration system.

Abuse Airflow and you will be in a world of hurt.

ETL logic goes in scripts, call the scripts from Airflow

I’ve recounted above why ETL logic can really bog down Airflow, make it hard to test, unstable — a plain old bad place to be. The solution to this is to place your ETL logic somewhere outside of Airflow. Airflow itself offers solutions to this believe it or not. For Airflow running on a VM, there’s BashOperator and DockerOperator. Both of these allow you to write and execute code in such a way that you can properly test the ETL code in isolation, away from Airflow. This is a huge benefit to you as an Airflow developer. Most of the time I would prefer Docker over Bash as you have more control over the execution environment, rather than running Bash locally.

If you are running Airflow on Kubernetes, then you also have an Airflow-native solution to removing custom code from Airflow — the KubernetesPodOperator.

The KubernetesPodOperator is an absolute shining gem. When it comes to removing custom logic from Airflow, Dockerising that logic and triggering it from Airflow is a great idea. To apply this to a Kubernetes world, you would spin out this docker-contained step into a pod, so that it is completely separate from the Airflow environment, maybe even running on a different machine!

Make friends with your airflow configuration

Good lord you can achieve a lot if you know what the Airflow configuration can do. It’s an absolute mammoth of a file, and can be quite daunting to those just learning about Airflow. I urge you to experiment with the configuration — at least in a safe place where you don’t mind blowing away the Airflow instance. I have a startling example of how important the Airflow configuration is to the behaviour of Airflow’s jobs. An Airflow-on-Kubernetes cluster that I was managing was executing a given DAG to completion in 30 minutes. I noticed that each task was taking a tiny amount of time to complete, but there was a large amount of time that the DAG waited for the next task to be scheduled. Given enough fiddling with the configuration, the DAG was performing much better — it went from a 30 minute execution to just under 5.

Such a performance gain was achieved purely through tweaks to the Airflow configuration file. Consider that you may be able to speed up your jobs, improve stability, and even increase your resource utilisation just through experimenting with your Airflow configuration for a day or two. It’s always worth a try.

Decoding what the Airflow configuration variables do can be frustrating, but it is 100% worth the effort.

Keep learning

I’d like to leave you, having confessed my sins and made reparations, with some further reading material that has helped me in my time with Airflow:

Time Management is Killing Creativity,"After Taylor’s intervention, the workers who were moving only twelve tons of iron a day were now moving forty-eight tons of iron a day. They quadrupled their productivity.

Only a few decades before Taylorism, most people’s concept of time was more closely linked to the movement of the sun than it was to the stopwatch hand. The availability of daylight, the height of a stalk of corn, or the day of first frost that signaled the coming of winter, ruled the work of farmhands.

Many of Taylor’s workers objected to having their movement so closely watched and timed, down to the second. Actually, more accurately than that — Taylor’s stopwatch timed according to the hundredth-of-a-minute.

But, “scientific management”, as it was called, swept through the industrial world. Companies couldn’t stay in business without adopting it.

The goal of Taylorism was to produce the most work possible in the minimum amount of time. As Taylor watched the movements of the workers, he was trying to reduce waste. He wanted each motion to be as quick and efficient as possible. He wanted each hundredth of a minute to bring the job closer to being done.

But, Taylor discovered there was a limit.

Logically, there’s no point in a worker sitting idle. Logically, if the worker keeps moving iron, he’ll move more iron than the worker who stops for a smoke break.

Intuitively, if you want to get the highest output possible out of the minimum amount of time, take your efficient movements, and fill all of the time with those movements.

But, Taylor discovered, it didn’t work that way.

The point of diminishing returns

There’s a concept in economics called the point of diminishing returns. We can see the point of diminishing returns in action if we imagine Frederick Taylor filling the yard of Bethlehem Steel with workers.

Imagine Frederick Taylor has one worker moving iron in the yard of Bethlehem Steel. Thanks to following Taylor’s prescribed movements, that worker is moving forty-eight tons of iron a day.

Then, Taylor adds another worker. Now, the workers are moving ninety-six tons of iron a day. Taylor can keep adding workers, and the productivity in the yard will keep going up by forty-eight tons for each worker Taylor adds.

Until…

Until they start to run out of space. There’s just not as much room in the yard for the workers to pick up the iron, and move it from one place to another. They get in each other’s way, they run into each other, or one worker will have to wait for another worker to finish his job before that first worker can finish his job.

At first, it’s not a huge problem. Taylor has merely reached the point of diminishing returns. The point of diminishing returns is the point at which each additional production unit — in this case, the production unit is workers — each worker doesn’t return as much benefit as the previous production units did. The return is diminishing.

At some point, Taylor adds a worker, and doesn’t get an additional forty-eight tons of production. He gets only forty. Like I say, it’s not a huge deal. They’re still moving more iron than they were before they added that worker. Their margins are high enough on the labor costs that they’re still making more profit.

Now, let’s apply this concept to a single worker. Only now the production unit isn’t the workers themselves. The production unit is time. As Taylor filled the available time with motion, the output of a worker rose.

But at some point, Taylor hit the point of diminishing returns. As he filled the available time with efficient, optimized motion, at some point, the additional time filled didn’t bring the returns that the previous units of time did. Maybe he tried instructing the worker to move three chunks of iron in ten minutes, then had no problem adding a fourth chunk of iron within that ten minutes. He could string together these ten-minute units, one after another. He could fill up a day with those units, and get the output he expected.

But then, at some point, moving an additional chunk of iron in that same unit of time didn’t bring Taylor the returns he expected. In this case, let’s say that number was five chunks of iron within ten minutes. Maybe the worker could keep it up for an hour, but soon the worker would get tired. Eventually, the worker couldn’t move that fifth chunk of iron within a ten-minute unit. The worker got too fatigued. Taylor had reached the point of diminishing returns.

The point of negative returns

Let’s go back to the steelyard, where Taylor is adding workers. At some point after the point of diminishing returns, Taylor isn’t getting forty-eight tons of output per additional worker, nor is he getting forty tons of output per additional worker.

At one point, workers were waiting for one another or getting in each other’s way once in awhile. But now the yard of Bethlehem Steel is nearly gridlocked. The workers are constantly in each other’s way. They’re getting fatigued holding the chunks of iron. Injuries are skyrocketing. Productivity in the steel yard collapses.

Taylor is way beyond the point of diminishing returns. Not only is he not getting the output he expected from adding an additional worker. That would be the point of diminishing returns.

Taylor has now hit the point of negative returns. He’s now getting less output overall per additional worker. For each worker Taylor adds, he’ll get less output than he would have if that worker had just stayed home.

Creative work is not industrial work

Scientific management is simple enough when you’re moving chunks of iron. Simply experiment with the amount of iron moved in a given amount of time. Eventually, you’ll find the right formula.

But creative work is different in a number of ways. There are three ways:

One: Some ideas are more valuable than others.

Two: It doesn’t take time to have an idea.

Three: In creativity, actions don’t link to results.

Some ideas are more valuable than others

First, some ideas are more valuable than others. Imagine you write two 50,000-word novels, in parallel. Let’s say you work equally as hard on the first novel as you do on the second novel. You spend just as much time typing the first novel as the second.

The first novel sells zero copies. The second one sells a million copies.

They’re both free of misspellings. They’re both quality writing. Why does one sell a million copies, while the other sells zero?

If the performance of the traditional publishing industry tells us anything, it’s that nobody has any idea why one novel falls flat and the other takes off.

But, you can know this: Not all ideas have equal market value. In fact, the difference in market value, for the same amount of work, can be infinite.

So, words typed, while a worthy unit of output to track if you’re trying to convince yourself you’re a writer, is not the only thing to optimize for. The quality of ideas matters.

Ideas don’t take time

The second thing that makes creative work different from moving chunks of iron is that moving chunks of iron takes time.

Yes, all of the things leading up to having an idea take time — we’ll talk about that next. But the act of having the idea takes no time at all.

Neuroscientists can look at people’s brains and give them a creative problem. The people can go from being nowhere near solving the problem, to solving the problem, in an instant.

Again, sitting yourself down and forcing yourself to come up with ideas is a worthy exercise. It will increase the output of ideas you have, it will build your skill in your craft, and it will increase the chances that one of those ideas is a hit.

But you may be just as likely to have that idea while not working at all. Remember Helmholtz’s speech from episode 218, about the Four Stages of creativity? He said his ideas didn’t tend to come to him “at the writing table.”

The moment of having an idea takes no time at all. Technically, you could have nearly unlimited ideas in a given “production unit” of time.

Actions aren’t linked to immediate results in creative work

Now, the third thing that makes creative work different from moving chunks of iron is that, in creative work, actions don’t link to results.

By that I mean that if you grip a chunk of iron and pick it up off the ground, you have done work. You have moved that chunk of iron a little closer to its destination.

Creative work doesn’t work that way.

Say you have an idea for that novel that sells a million copies. Where did it come from?

Think about Paul McCartney’s song, “Yesterday.” McCartney famously heard the melody for “Yesterday” in a dream. At first, he was convinced it was a melody he had heard before. He thought it was an old Jazz tune his father had played when he was a kid.

“Yesterday” has stood the test of time as an original song. But musicologists have found numerous similarities to other songs.

One such song is called “Answer Me, My Love.”

“Yesterday”’s lyrics are as such:

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,

Now it looks as though they’re here to stay,

“Answer Me, My Love”’s lyrics are as such:

She was mine yesterday,

I believed that love was here to stay.

McCartney didn’t steal from “Answer Me, My Love.” But it’s almost certain that he heard the song before. In 1953, when McCartney was eleven years old, a version of “Answer Me, My Love,” by David Whitfield was the number one song on the UK charts.

Then, it got knocked from the number-one spot — by another version of “Answer Me, My Love,” this time, by Frankie Lane. It was the first time in UK pop chart history that a song was replaced by another version of itself.

Was McCartney inspired by this song? It’s impossible to know for sure, but it’s certainly plausible.

So this idea you have for a novel that sells a million copies. Maybe you’re in the right state of mind to have this idea because you took a vacation last month. Maybe you’re more relaxed because you got a massage two days ago. Maybe you’re thinking more clearly because you went on a hike earlier that day. Yet it was the funny red hat worn by the woman who walked by the cafe that sparked the idea. Meanwhile, it could have been inspired by some book, buried deep in your unconscious, that your mom read to you when you were three.

We’re done with time management

Taylorism was the birth of “time management.” It was when we started to look at time as a “production unit.”

When we look at time as a production unit, we assume that each additional unit of time we spend doing something will get us the same gain in output as the previous unit of time.

But it doesn’t work that way. Even in work as simple as moving chunks of iron, Taylor learned that human energy doesn’t neatly pack together to fill all available time. We have our limits.

Today, we’re still treating time as a production unit. Our calendars are filled up with boxes, sometimes overlapping. Jason Fried calls it “calendar Tetris.” We live according to that calendar.

“There’s only twenty-four hours in a day,” you’ll hear people say. The conclusion we’re supposed to draw from that is that time is precious, so you better fill it all up.

Filling up that time was a big leap forward, but now we need to draw a different conclusion. If there’s only twenty-four hours in a day, that tells you there’s a limit. That tells you that eventually, “time management” is squeezing blood from a stone. When it comes to creative work, that stone is a very fragile stone, indeed.",https://medium.com/getting-art-done/time-management-kills-creativity-39ddaa5acdaa,David Kadavy,2020-06-12 18:37:19.593000+00:00,"Creativity,Time Management,Productivity,Writing"
"Aspirin May Treat Severe Covid-19 Disease, and That Tells Us Something Important","Aspirin May Treat Severe Covid-19 Disease, and That Tells Us Something Important

Aspirin may turn out to be a cheap and effective way to save lives and prevent lasting damage

Back in April, when the first wave of Covid-19 was crashing across the U.S., Michael Mazzeffi received an email from one of his colleagues at the University of Maryland Medical Center.

“One of our surgeons said that when he was drawing blood out of a patient, it literally clotted within five seconds,” says Mazzeffi, who is chief of the division of critical care anesthesiology. “It was pretty clear early on that patients with severe Covid had clotting disorders and that their blood was super coagulable.”

Clinicians around the world noticed this same clotting phenomenon. By mid-summer, autopsies of people who had died from Covid-19 revealed that their vasculature and organs were often suffused with clots and coagulated blood. “What we saw in the Covid ICU is that a lot of the patients would start developing a lot of clotting, and this high burden would lead to multi-organ failure and eventually death,” says Jonathan Chow, MD, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

Because clotting seemed to be a signature of severe or damaging Covid-19 disease, Chow and Mazzeffi started to discuss whether aspirin — a blood-thinning drug that can block the formation of clots — could help improve outcomes. “Aspirin is a very potent antiplatelet agent,” Chow explains. Platelets are blood-cell fragments that, when activated, will clump together to form clots. “As soon as aspirin interacts with a platelet, that platelet becomes inactivated and can no longer participate in the clot-generating process,” he says.

For a study published on October 21 in the journal Anesthesia and Analgesia, Chow and Mazzeffi — along with a multi-university team of researchers — examined the effects of aspirin among people hospitalized with Covid-19. After adjusting their data to account for age, BMI, race, preexisting conditions, and other variables that could muddy their conclusions, they determined that the risk of death or ICU admission was almost halved among people who got aspirin compared to those who did not.

“This is now the second study linking blood thinners of some kind with improved outcomes,” Mazzeffi says. “I think it’s driving home the point that an important part of the disease’s process is clotting in the organs and that intervening in those pathways is something we should focus on.”

What this research tells us about the coronavirus

SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, and the illness it causes is often described as primarily respiratory in nature. But that’s turning out to be an oversimplification — especially for those who develop severe Covid-19 disease or symptoms that persist long after the initial infection has passed.

“It’s a whole-body virus,” says Girish Nadkarni, a doctor of internal medicine at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. “It affects the kidneys, the brain, the blood vessels, and the heart. So it’s not just a respiratory virus.”

These anti-clotting and anti-inflammation benefits explain why plain old aspirin is such a widely deployed drug — and also why it may eventually prove helpful in treating Covid-19.

In July, Nadkarni and colleagues published a study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology that looked at the effect of anticoagulant drugs on outcomes among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Like the aspirin study that would follow a few months later, Nadkarni’s study found that anticoagulants significantly reduced the risk of death among certain groups of people with Covid-19. “We found that both prophylactic and therapeutic doses of anticoagulation led to a lower risk of intubation and mortality,” he summarizes.

Both his research and the aspirin study support the idea that — contrary to early assumptions — Covid-19 may be best characterized as a blood-vessel disease.

Follow-up work and confirmation studies are needed. But Nadkarni says that the idea that a blood-thinning drug like aspirin could protect people from Covid-19 is credible. “Aspirin and anticoagulant drugs both prevent clots, albeit in slightly different ways,” he explains. While aspirin shuts off the clot-forming activity of platelets, anticoagulant drugs act on clotting factors, which are proteins in the blood that help control the rate of bleeding.

Many common and lethal illnesses — including diabetes, heart disease, and several others that are associated with a heightened risk for severe Covid-19 disease — also promote blood coagulation and clotting, Nadkarni says. And along with helping to prevent clots, aspirin also combats inflammation, which is implicated in a wide range of medical conditions. Together, these anti-clotting and anti-inflammation benefits explain why plain old aspirin is such a widely deployed drug — and also why it may eventually prove helpful in treating Covid-19.

“The fact that [SARS-CoV-2] creates this hypercoagulable state is really fascinating because few other respiratory viruses do that to the same degree,” says Mazzeffi. He explains that there are specialized blood cells, called endothelial cells, that line the arteries, veins, and other blood-transporting vessels. “These endothelial cells maintain vascular integrity and help keep blood flow normal,” he says. “SARS-CoV-2 affects those cells and causes inflammation that may cause those cells to express things that cause clotting.”

The coronavirus and the disease states it causes are complex, he adds. But aspirin may turn out to be a cheap and effective way to save lives and prevent lasting damage.

“If someone becomes ill [with SARS-CoV-2] and their doctor says it’s safe for them to take aspirin, I think it’s reasonable for them to take it.”

Should at-risk people consider taking aspirin?

Doctors are usually hesitant to recommend a treatment that does not have a large body of evidence to support it. But Mazzeffi says that aspirin is such a familiar drug and its risks and safety profile are so well established that people who are exposed to the coronavirus may want to consider taking it in low doses.

“The good thing about aspirin is that it’s one of the best-studied drugs in the history of the Earth,” he says. “We know it’s not safe for everyone, but it’s taken by literally hundreds of millions of patients, and it has a great safety record.”

The greatest risk associated with aspirin is gastrointestinal bleeding. “If you have a history of peptic ulcers or bleeding from the stomach, then it may not be safe,” he says. Also, his study didn’t look at the effects of aspirin among children with SARS-CoV-2 — a group that already seems to be at low risk for severe Covid-19-related complications. “People shouldn’t be popping aspirin in kids,” he says.

But for most adults, taking a single low-dose (81 mg) aspirin pill each day for a period of a few weeks may be a low-risk, high-reward proposition.

“If someone becomes ill [with SARS-CoV-2] and their doctor says it’s safe for them to take aspirin, I think it’s reasonable for them to take it,” Mazzeffi says.",https://elemental.medium.com/aspirin-may-treat-severe-covid-19-disease-and-that-tells-us-something-important-fb486dfe3298,Markham Heid,2020-11-05 06:33:29.419000+00:00,"Health,Covid 19,The Nuance,Coronavirus,Science"
7 Ways Art Dissolves Writer’s Block,"Creativity and art are so important - I cannot stress it enough - to keep the world sane enough to survive, to keep our minds balanced. If more people allowed themselves to explore their creative, chaotic sides artistically, there would be less madness, less chaos out there. There would be more contentment. Art of any kind is a balm to the jaded soul.

That said, I had a bad state of depression this time last year, owing to life changes and adjustment issues. I was unable to write. My second novel got stranded and I simply could not out word after word. I avoided opening the manuscript file on my computer. I realized I had to work with my depression and as a creative person, as a writer, it was enough for me to be able to get back to my art. Writing often helps me get through low times but then, during depressive states, writing altogether took a backseat in my life. All the while, it just made me feel worse because I was not able to do the one thing that would lift me up — write.

That’s when I kept coming across profiles of artists on Instagram. Artists working with acrylics and oil paints on canvas. I had been a fairly artsy kid and used to sketch a bit but never played with paint. I shied away from pursuing art and focused on writing. Then, I had this crazy idea — why not, just why not try painting? And I ordered acrylic paints, canvas panels and sheets, palette, palette knives, brushes, oil pastels and pastel papers.

I painted in abandon and was surprised to find that it is something I trust myself to do. I painted my way out of depression. Four pictures in, I resumed writing my novel and completed the rest of it within two months. So, here’s what art therapy at home taught me. An alternative form of art — here, I ventured with painting and it could be anything for you — dissolved my writer’s block or whatever creative block I was experiencing.

An alternate path for creative energy to flow

The first realization I had was, it was essential to keep the flow. Creativity needs to be let out — be it words, colors, images or anything. When there is a block in the pipelines, you need to give it a shunt or a bypass. You need to open another valve and tap to let the waters out.

An excess of creative energy had accumulated in me, finding no outlet, while I was depressed. When I painted, I found the creative energy which was accumulated, clogged and fermenting in my brain was slowly being drained out. The alternate path for this creative energy to flow relieved the internal pressure and helped to lessen the guilty feeling of not helping myself. Healing came, slowly but steadily.

Unleashing the internal chaos

If not through writing, I had to tell the world about the chaos in my head somehow. Through brush strokes, I was able to put the wrought-iron thoughts and feelings of worthlessness into colors. That meant something. Chaos is inherent to every creative soul and it has to be converted into something beautiful — poetry, stories, paintings, statues, crafts or songs.

It felt good to find that if not one, I had another way to unleash the confusion in my head, another way to convert the internal chaos into something enjoyable. Another way to tell my story.

Liberate yourself

The very essence of art is the liberation enfolded into it. Art is a form of expression — there is no argument over that. Expression in any form is a discharge of thoughts, perceptions, and emotions. This is simply tipping a brimmed cup and letting out some of the fluid sloshings in it, freeing up space.

Painting allowed me to tip over a cup of colors over the blank canvas, create something enjoyable and feel liberated to the extent of being ready to face the world again.

Refreshing the brain and calming the soul

While writing is a very active process, brainstorming and sequential thoughts being a part of it, knotting one thread with another, painting proved to be the opposite to me. While writing made my brain fatigue, painting calmed my soul. Writing is indeed something essential to me as long as I live, but I found that painting had a tranquilizing effect on a highly wired-up brain after writing. The unwinding effect of playing with colors and letting the brush swipe over the canvas and forming shapes and things was paramount.

After a long episode of writing fervently, I would have pushed my limits. Painting allowed to soften the edges and let the soul take over. Painting was simply a conversation the soul had alone and unlike writing a story with many characters and lives, painting had only one destination — create something colorful on the canvas. There was no scope for a loophole when you are just painting to refresh and calm yourself.

Productivity even during a creative block

The hardest thing to do when you are in a creative or writer’s block is to be productive. Staying productive somehow is an ideal state to be in but often it is not possible. When I took up painting to heal, I discovered that productivity comes whenever you do something. It doesn’t always have to be what you are meant to do, as long as you produce something. I allowed myself to forget about writing and indulge in painting, learning basics, and new techniques, learning about art supplies, watching painting videos on YouTube and my confidence in this new arena grew.

I told myself, even if you cannot write, you can still be creative, you can still paint. And that opened up a whole new world for me. The moment I feel blocked, I stop pushing myself and take out the paints, including watercolors that I recently ventured with, and do something with it. Sometimes, it is the same kind of picture, sometimes entirely different. Sometimes, a gift for a loved one. The idea is to produce something and when it is achieved, I am no longer unproductive and non-creative. There is less guilt to handle. You would have done something creative and sometimes, that is enough to keep your spirits up, which is the first step to overcoming writer’s block.

Taking shifts

Painting uses an altogether different center of our brain and a whole bunch of different neurons. Each form of art is different and requires a different set of neurons to work with. When we switch from one form of creativity to another, we are allowing the writing-brain to take a break and rest. Often procrastination is said to be the brain’s way of taking a break and refreshing itself. We might as well use that time to engage other parts of our brain and do something we enjoy. Many writers love sketching, traveling, cooking or baking or many other hobbies. These allow the various parts of our brain to take shifts and let our main working part — the writing brain — to take the well-deserved rest.

New potential ideas

When you embark on another creative art, you experience a whole different lifestyle. Even if it is for a short time, it counts as an experience and it is very likely to give you new potential ideas for your writing. For example, venturing with painting gave me the ideas and the experiences to write this article. But that’s just one possibility. There are several.

3 ways of using storytelling in design,"3 ways of using storytelling in design

How I rediscovered my favorite childhood activities.

Me as a 5-year-old making stories

As a child, I loved creating stories. From the time I could hold a pencil, I would write little books and illustrate them. I continued doing this until my teenage years.

But when it came time to start looking at universities and choose a major, I decided to go for something related to art that would allow me to earn a steady income: I chose to work as a graphic designer. Unfortunately, I ended up in a role doing routine work and production design. While some people enjoy this type of work, I did not; I felt bored and stifled.

In an effort to move out of print production design, I went back to get a master’s degree and ended up in the field of user experience design, stumbling into it mostly by accident. I loved that UX allowed me to talk with people, understand their needs, and help figure out what to create for them. I loved the impact that I could have on millions of people’s lives and work experiences by designing better software products.

What I didn’t expect was that so much of my work would involve a return back to what I loved as a child: using images and words to tell stories.

Pages from a story I wrote and illustrated when I was young

When I think about how I’ve used storytelling in my role as a designer, it generally falls into three distinct categories:

Using storytelling to

Understand and advocate for users Create lovable, user-friendly products Present a design vision

In this post I’ll share examples with you of each of these. I hope it helps inspire you to tell more stories at work and possibly even reuse some of your favorite childhood skills.

Using stories to understand and advocate for our users

One of the ways that we understand our users is through talking with them — doing interviews or contextual inquiry. And one of the best ways I’ve found to discover people’s needs is to ask them to tell you a story. It’s useful because it allows the participant to share what actually has happened in the past, rather than imagine what might happen in the future. It also allows you to follow up with questions about their emotions, goals, and beliefs behind their actions.

Certain experiences will stand out more vividly in people’s minds which makes them a good area of focus for stories. I will never forget this helpful (and rhyming) phrase that Jeff Patton shared in a workshop which he led a few years ago:

“People remember the last time, the first time, the best time, and the worst time.”

For example, you can ask about the first time someone logged into your product, the last time they had to contact customer support, the best or worst experience they’ve had with online shopping, etc.

After people have told us their stories, we then can use storytelling to engage our teams back in the office and advocate for our users. Stories with a conflict, an emotional arc, and a resolution will get your audience’s attention and help them remember the main idea later.",https://uxdesign.cc/3-ways-of-using-storytelling-in-design-ffd67e9f0d8d,Jenny Shirey,2020-04-19 17:03:54.420000+00:00,"Storytelling,UX Research,Design,UX,Marketing"
23 Traits of Successful Entrepreneurs,"Execute

All the dreaming and planning in the world won’t mean anything if you never put the rubber to the pavement. Within EXECUTE, successful entrepreneurs:

Do

Successful entrepreneurs don’t overplan to the point of paralysis. Sometimes a little uncertainty can leave some good room for creativity. But despite all of the doing, you have to remember that your most important customer is your current paying customer! Take good care of the customers who already support you.

Keep a Calendar

You have better chances for productivity and efficiency if you organize your day before the day begins. Of course, there will be interruptions, but it’s better to have a course designed as opposed to “freestyling” it all day.

Keep a Checklist

This is the next progression from keeping a calendar. Turn your tasks on your calendar into smaller attainable action items and mark them off upon completion. This is one of those things that separate successful entrepreneurs from the pack. Your checklist can be on paper or in digital form. The point is to have a way to track your productivity.

Delegate

You can’t do it all. Find some people around you to execute the tasks that you can’t do or get to in a timely fashion. Also, you’re not great at all things. Try to only delegate tasks to people who can do the task better (or at about the same level) and faster than you can.

Measure

Successful entrepreneurs always know where they stand with their key performance metrics/indicators. KPIs include things like phone calls made or emails sent, meetings secured, deals closed, product returns (the lower the better), or homes shown (for my real estate agent friends).

Pivot

Failing fast and moving on isn’t always a good idea. Sometimes it takes a few tries in order to successfully execute on a business idea. With that said, successful entrepreneurs know how to make the proper tweaks to their marketing plan, business model, and/or product or service offering in order to get their business on the right track.

Persevere

Successful entrepreneurs are in it to win it and they won’t let a few bumps in the road deter them from their goal(s). Some failure is temporary and success sometimes comes down to how well and how often you get up after getting knocked down.",https://medium.com/craft-writes/23-traits-of-successful-entrepreneurs-fc35e2629537,Chris Craft,2020-11-03 14:09:27.748000+00:00,"Marketing,Learning,Business,Entrepreneurship,Productivity"

4 strategies to help you keep writing even in busiest times

Credit: Adobe Stock

Often, you will hear writers complain that they don’t have any time to write when, in fact, they mean they don’t have the perfect confluence of time and solitude to sit and bang out a few hundred words in one sitting. Many times, you’ll see someone post on social media that they just can’t find the time to write anymore, followed by a post in which they talk about all the shows they’ve binge-watched on Netflix.

Seriously? If you have time to binge-watch programs on Netflix or Amazon Prime, you have time to write. And if you don’t write despite having time to binge-watch shows, no amount of justification of your inaction to others will ever help.

If all of this sounds familiar, start by jettisoning one phrase from your lexicon, it is this: “I just can’t find time…” No one “finds” time. Time is not like some loose change we discover fallen behind the pillow on your sofa. We “make” time, or we “steal” time. Or we use the time in a way that may not be optimal, but is time nonetheless.

I myself often feel the temptation to justify my own dry periods by saying things like “Well, I had too much to do this week. I just didn’t have time to go sit in a coffee shop for a whole morning.” I have to repeatedly remind myself that I do not need to wait until I have both time and an idea to sit down and write something. Anything.

The most important thing to remember is to always have your journal with you, or at least a small notepad or a few sheets of notepaper. It helps to be prepared for any periods in which you are forced to sit and wait for any length of time: in your car waiting to pick up your child from sport/music/dance lessons, in line at the post office the week before Christmas, or even in the waiting room at your doctor’s office. Steal those moments for your writing.

The following three strategies are ones that I always have to fall back on. They serve as reminders that even 5, 10, or 20 minutes is enough time to put pen to paper and hone a few writing skills.

1. Practice descriptions

Look around you. What do you notice? Practice noticing the smallest details about people or places around you. Do a character study or portrait. Invent a backstory to the person sitting across from you. What is their life like? How did they start their day? Oh, they have a scar … where did they get that?

Here’s a great example of a description from the novel Q&A by Vikas Swarup:

“Delhi’s Juvenile Home diminished us, but Dharavi’s grim landscape of urban squalor deadens and debases us. Its open drains teem with mosquitoes. Its stinking, excrement-lined communal latrines are full of rats, which make you think less about the smell and more about protecting your backside. Mounds of filthy garbage lie on every corner, from which rag-pickers till manage to find something useful. And at times you have to suck in your breath to squeeze through its narrow, claustrophobic alleys. But for the starving residents of Dharavi, this is home.”

2. Practice similes

Sometimes I like to give my imagination a workout with simple sensory exercises. What sound do you hear? What is making that sound? If you already know the source of a sound, think of all the other things (real and imagined) that could also make that sound. What about smells? What about things you can touch with your eyes closed?

Here’s an example from John Irving’s children’s book, A Sound Like Someone Trying Not to Make a Sound:

“It sounded like a monster with no arms and no legs, but it was trying to move … It was a sound like, in the closet, if one of Mommy’s dresses came alive and it tried to climb down off the hanger … It was a sound like someone pulling the nails out of the floorboards under the bed … It was a sound like a ghost in the attic, dropping the peanuts it had stolen from the kitchen … It was a sound like someone trying not to make a sound.”

3. Practice rhyming

Look around you or, perhaps, pick up a magazine, open a random book. What’s the first word you see? Write it down. Then write down all the words you can think of that rhyme with the original word. Start with one syllable then work up to two, three, four, or more. This easy exercise will help you to bring forward in your mind words that you do not typically use, so that they will be at-the-ready the next time you are in full-on writing mode.

4. Revise your drafts

Revision is also writing. If you have an article, blog post, essay, short story, or poem that you’ve been working on, print it out and carry it around with you. Use your stolen moments as a chance to deep dive into the revision or editing process. Here are a couple of ideas that closely relate to the old saying, “Show, don’t tell.” This means showing your reader images that help them understand how “sad” a situation is, instead of simply telling them, “It was such a sad situation.”

Examine your verb choices.

When you find yourself using a lot of adverbs to bolster your verbs, this means the verb you chose may be weak. Use your stolen moments to figure out a visual way of showing the way that the verb is being performed. For example:

He walked very slowly — You can strengthen this by saying something like “His feet moved as if they had weights tied to them.”

The car drove quickly down the street — You can strengthen this by saying something like “The car sped down the street.”

Prices rose sharply — You can strengthen this by saying something like “Prices skyrocketed.”

Watch out for abstract nouns and adjectives

Nouns such as “beauty” and “justice” are abstract, as are the adjectives associated with them — “beautiful” and “just.” Readers can’t see beauty or hear justice. What they can see or hear are concrete examples of these things. In your writing, try to avoid abstract nouns in favor of giving your readers examples that will illustrate something that is “just” or something that is “beautiful.”

Another good rule is to avoid reliance on adjectives that require judgement, such as “dark,” “deep,” and “strong.” How dark is dark? Is it as dark as the bottom of a well? Or is it as dark as tar melting under an August sun? How deep is deep? Is it as deep as a thimble? Or is it as deep as the gaping mouth of the Grand Canyon? How strong is strong? Is it as strong as the coffee that’s been left for five hours on the burner? Or is it as strong as the memory of your first kiss?

Not everyone can put their jobs on hold for two weeks to head to a writer's residency. But, that doesn’t mean you can’t take the time to write. Even a brief exercise like one of those listed above has the innate potential to bring forward a line or two that just might be the beginning (or end) to a new story, essay, or poem.",https://medium.com/storiusmag/writing-in-the-stolen-moments-6190cdfc9385,Bernadette Geyer,2020-03-22 19:07:28.726000+00:00,"Fiction,Writing,Writing Tips,Storytelling,Productivity"

Apple enters Digital Payments, Global Streaming Internet by SpaceX & Microsoft’s Blockchain Projects

Welcome to the first edition of Tech Diaries — my new blogging series about important issues pertaining to the tech world. For those you who have across my other blogs, I have a similar edition called Crypto Diaries which pertains mainly to Cryptocurrencies & Blockchain. So without further delay, let’s dig into the Tech World.

Apple Card

I still remember how excited I was when I got the first edition of the iPhone years ago. Apple brought in a revolution with its smartphone devices. Over the years, Apple has become one of the biggest & most valuable brand names in the World. It is one of the elite members of the tech group dubbed as GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple).

Last year, Apple was the first of the big four to hit the $1 trillion mark valuation followed by Amazon & most recently Microsoft. Market correction recently has brought down the valuation of these companies from the highs, but all four of them are still within touching distance of that coveted prize.

Coming back to Apple, the strong growth over the years has been spearheaded by its flagship product — the iPhone. While Korea’s Samsung & Chinese Huawei have squeezed Apple’s smartphone market share, but a loyal customer base has been Apple’s biggest prize.

For years iPhone printed money for Apple but with increased competition & squeezing gross margins, Apple’s growth began to stall around 2016. This was about the time when they realized that stagnating innovation & higher-priced phones were not going to spur the growth.

They needed to diversify into something which can outlast the shine on the brand new iPhone. Services like Apple Music, App Store purchases, iCloud subscriptions, as well as new products such as the Apple Watch, AirPods and the HomePod have given a new lease of life to the dwindling revenue of the company. The most important announcement yet in this tilt towards subscription services came in March when Apple announced the launch of the Apple card.

The latest innovation from Apple is a digital payment system with the conveniences customers desire — No late fees, No wait to qualify, Cash backs of up to 3% & No long strings of numbers! While its tech counterpart Facebook mulls over developing its own digital payment system for its social media empire, Apple has already taken the first step towards the future of money.

And the one thing that Apple has an abundance of that Facebook doesn’t is the trust factor of its client base. Apple is basically enhancing the user experience by providing interactive tools & charts in the Daily Cash App to track your balances, cash-backs, payments, expenses, etc. This will strengthen its ever-growing ecosystem of Apps, services & hardware even further.

Apple has also promised not to eavesdrop on your spending habits — a believable claim considering there haven’t been any data breach scandals, unlike its contemporaries FB & Google which are much more reliant on third-party advertisements for their revenue generation, not to forget their data breaches!

Endeavors like this are shaping how the future of money looks like & this summer we will find out how Apple Card is received by consumers. There is a small catch though — are you willing to buy a $1000 smartphone to access all this?

Global Internet

I respect Elon Musk as a true visionary of our times, despite his tweeting rants and his occasional pot smoking podcasts. Companies like Tesla, Solar City, SpaceX, Hyperloop, OpenAI, Neuralink are the brainchild of this genius. His financial troubles, especially at Tesla, maybe a topic for another day.

But for now, SpaceX is launching the first batch of 60 satellites today for the company’s Starlink project — an endeavor to provide broadband internet service to the global population by beaming it from the satellites positioned in the low-Earth orbit (LEO).

These satellites can basically beam the internet to anywhere on the globe. To achieve this kind of global connectivity, a constellation of about 12,000 satellites would be needed eventually. The network of satellites would be communicating with each other via lasers and will deliver 40 times faster internet that current satellite service by employing Ku/Ka-band broadband.

The Falcon 9 will be launching the first batch of satellites later today. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is planning a similar project called ‘Project Kuiper’ where 3,236 satellites would be used to provide a global broadband internet service, which would be launched via its new New Glenn rocket in 2021. Either way, these are significant steps towards bridging the global digital divide. Bravo!

The critics, however, argue that kind of massive satellite deployment is going to aggravate the burgeoning space junk problem that we are dealing within the Earth’s orbit. Scientific American states a worst-case scenario can trigger “ Kessler syndrome “ — triggering a cascade of space debris which would trap humans on Earth.

SpaceX defended the action by saying that the satellites will be orbiting in a much lower orbit keeping them out of range of the current space debris in higher orbit & also easier to retire once they have outlived their usefulness — which will happen after 5 years, according to NASA. Let’s look at the bright side… Shall we?

Microsoft affinity to Blockchain

Microsoft has evolved tremendously from being largely a software producer of its Windows operation system which controlled the majority of the computer systems around the World in the ’90s. The gradual shift towards services under the dynamic leadership of its current CEO Satya Nadella has given it a new innovative spirit backed by strong growth. As you can see the company’s rock-solid performance evident from the charts above.

The important thing to note is that of the $110.36 billion in revenue in 2018, $27.6 billion or almost a quarter of it came from its Microsoft Azure Cloud service. Talking about its Azure Cloud service — the platform has started to take a liking towards blockchain over the past year with the releases of its blockchain development kit and the Azure Blockchain Workbench.

Two weeks ago, the company released Azure Blockchain Services — a full managed BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) platform that allows the formation, management & governance of the consortium blockchain networks. The release also supports other advanced tools for its developers including AI, mixed reality, IoT. This came on the heels of Amazon launching its own BaaS platform — Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB).

More recently, the Seattle-based tech giant also announced that it is building a decentralized identity (DID) network on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The open standards infrastructure, known as the Identity Overlay Network (ION) will give control of data to the users backed by decentralized networks while enabling privacy & security at the same time.

The main net for the platform will be launched in the coming months. These moves by tech giants signal a move towards broader blockchain adoption & bode well for the future of this technology.

Before wrapping up, just a quick recap with what’s happening with Huawei — the Chinese tech giant. With the trade war escalation, U.S has just announced broad-based curbs on the company. The move would effectively stop American companies from using Huawei’s equipment or providing it with any essential supplies. The company which is already facing severe challenges with the roll-out of its 5G networks globally in the face of American opposition could be headed for more trouble.

Letting Go of Diagnoses Improved My Mental Health,"Letting Go of Diagnoses Improved My Mental Health

And it just might work for you, too.

2017 was a really bad year for me. I ringed in the New Year in a psychiatric facility, and though my time there was brief, it led to a circus that included a new psychiatrist and a whole bunch of new medication. Along with that circus came a bunch of diagnoses I hadn’t ever heard of before, which included:

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)

Bipolar Disorder

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

For years, I was treated with Lithium, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, Lamictal, Abilify, Doxapine, Trazodone, Latuda, and others. At any given time, I was on four to six different antipsychotic, antidepressant, mood-stabilizing, and anxiety-reducing medications at once. For a few brief years, I was a shell of myself hiding behind the cocktail I was prescribed.

Sadly, I let this go on for so long because I was allowing my diagnoses to define me. Behind every thought, word, and action that comprised my being, there were my mental illnesses. In any given day, I had a panic attack (PTSD), I dissociated frequently (BPD, PTSD), had some kind of a tantrum due to my unstable sense of self (BPD), and had an intense mood swing that brought me back up on my feet and feeling like I was on top of the world (Bipolar Disorder).

After three and a half painstaking years, I found myself with a new psychiatrist whose prescriptions were minimally invasive and whose thoughts on my prior diagnoses were a bit different than that of what I was used to.

She firmly believed that my BPD would improve over time and assured me that my condition should be first treated by therapy as the main course of action — she assured me that medication should be a boost and not the go-to solution for my conditions. I found a great therapist due to her, and with my new lifestyle as a person who was no longer over-medicated, I began to slowly but surely thrive.

Even my new therapist barely mentioned the names of my disorders to me when we were combing through the tangled messes that my maladies often left me with. She didn’t think of me as a diseased or disabled person — she just thought of me as a person. Being treated so differently than I had been from the team of doctors linked to the hospital was utterly refreshing and revitalizing.

Now, after years of feeling like a zombie, I was clear again. I still relied on medication to help prevent me from tipping into psychosis and other problematic states, and especially relied on it to help me through my night terrors and other sleep problems, but now I wasn’t over-medicated. Slowly but surely, I began to see myself as more than my diagnoses and to feel a greater sense of command over my body now that I wasn’t numb from the consequences of being treated like a sickly person.

The search for mental wellness is not always easy. I know this firsthand. Now that I have a better team of mental health professionals around me, I feel a sense of support that goes beyond medication. I feel that I suffered for so many years for a good reason and that the suffering I felt at the beginning of my wellness journey was very important in being able to lead a happy life now.

Is my life perfect now that I’ve stopped over analyzing my diagnoses? No.

In fact, some of those very words — like BPD — saved my life. Without my Borderline diagnosis, I would have never discovered Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), perhaps the greatest tool I have for everything from emotional regulation to distress tolerance. Diagnoses are important and do not need to be overanalyzed to the point of becoming a limitation. They tell professionals how to get us the best help possible based on decades of research.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a diagnosis, you are not alone. There is a way of acknowledging an illness without allowing it to consume us. I believe that over time, finding wellness becomes easier and we must learn graciously from the trial and error that comes with medication, therapy, and other tools to live our best lives.",https://medium.com/invisible-illness/letting-go-of-diagnoses-improved-my-mental-health-d1a04756c600,H.

We are fools who believe You are there,

if You are not there;

Otherwise, if You are there, we must wait confidently and patiently. . .

Who is right and who is wrong

only time will tell.

as we sniff to investigate the terrain,

trying to discern the territory

as our senses, emotions, instincts and intelligence

try to sway our thinking,

battling amongst themselves and then against

each other, in our hopeless pursuit to discover

who will come out on top.

Those who believe or those who do not.

Much is invested in this age-old question,

and each side is certain it is right.

How long will we wait …

the further time goes forth,

the more unbelievers become victorious,

and those of us who believe wait and wonder,

unperturbed.

For You have called it long ago,

that we must remain steadfast, for nobody is to know …

That the time is now at hand.

What Story Can You Tell That Only You Could?,"What Story Can You Tell That Only You Could?

You Have No Idea Who is Waiting On Your Story

This question has bothered me for weeks. The easy deflection I could come up with is that I should just keep writing and the story will tell itself. However, as I study better writers — especially here on Medium- I realize that this blind dive can only help for so far.

Then, you hit a wall.

Your writing becomes a rehash of everything you’ve said and when you try to “copy” others in the hope of improving, your voice airs like Frankenstein’s dirty, electric, underwear.

That’s why the question is becoming key in my process.

I am taking a writing course that’s forcing me to pause and really understand what “good writing” is. I’m reading popular articles and taking note of what certain pieces make me feel — especially trying to crack the elusive “headline code”.

In all this, I know I won’t improve in a few months. I know I will need to write and test and keep showing up.

Taking the time to reflect on this question does not remove the work required.

Photo by bruce mars on Unsplash

What changed?

Writing happened organically for me. I wasn’t really outspoken as a child. I wasn’t popular for anything ( except wearing glasses and having multiple surgeries which made sure while all my school mates did mandatory manual labor in boarding school, I had to watch from the sidelines because I was labeled “a patient”).

The thoughts I carried never had a way out. I can’t remember anyone even urging me to start a blog. It was the most natural thing.

As I shared my heartbreak stories, poetry, and cringe-worthy fiction, I grew an audience of people who knew me personally and actually enjoyed what I wrote. I would meet people who gave me compliments and said it was really good.

It was nice to hear but didn’t mean much.

Fast forward a few years of this, a couple of jobs I hated, moving to the US, getting married and “growing up”, now this innocent love for writing has become something else — something I want to do with the rest of my life.

There’s a certain balance to making such decisions, I have come to realize: if you push too much, you become stubborn to necessary changes. For example, if I think I have innate talent and can’t learn much from a writing course or a book, then I am doomed to fail this life goal.

On the other hand, if I don’t take this seriously enough; if I don’t invest the time and effort required — I won’t improve on the existing skill, nor would I learn the ancillary skills needed to thrive as a writer in this age.

It’s the balance that begs the question.

A story ( or stories) only I could write, guarantee the unique nature of my value proposition to the world. But this story, if poorly told, doesn’t move the dilemma.

Photo by Dariusz Sankowski on Unsplash

The first step is to identify the story.

What will I write about? Why does it matter? Who is it for?

The next step, obviously, is to tell the story.

What’s the best way to say it? How can I tell it in such a way that no one else could such that it will be truly mine?

We all know a friend who knows how to tell the best stories. When something happens and he/she is present, we don’t mind telling them to narrate what happened because we know they’re good at it.

Everyone is good at something. We all have something inside that we naturally gravitate towards and that calls us to make — a calling.

The difficulty I have — which I think most people do — is finding that balance between working blindly on your calling and getting help.

Between telling the same stories and changing things up. Between rehashing personal life anecdotes and digging deeper.

I once read somewhere that in order to be a writer, you have to live a full life. That your stories will come from living. There’s a lot of truth in this.

Yet, as we’re all holed up at home and working remotely, I wonder how much of life we’re living. I wonder if this confinement isn’t the trigger we needed to realize that life doesn’t have to mean physical travel or seeing places.

That maybe, just maybe, we have more stories in us than we’ve dared to explore.

As I consider this, I realize that yes, I may have written about the heartbreak, but I never delved deeper into how that changed me or affected the way I now behave in my relationship.

I may have written about my fresh experience in the US, but not about how I no longer associate myself with the label “immigrant”.

I may have mentioned my highschool years weren’t fun, but I’ve never explored how the culture set me- and others — up to be unprepared for real-life problems with many of us unemotionally mature enough to deal with many things.

Photo by Dawid Zawiła on Unsplash

There’s more than meets the eye, yo.

There are so many stories we have inside of us, waiting to be called out. Because we’re not still enough — not willing to sit with our thoughts — or not willing to engage in deeper thought and journaling, we “waste” stories that could otherwise be valuable to others.

So, when I ask this question, what story could you write that no one else could: it doesn’t mean the next Harry Potter. It doesn’t mean working on a story until it’s “perfect” or waiting until you feel like a writer before you write.

No.

It means going inside, finding a truth you have that you may not have articulated, then sharing to the best of your abilities.

This will require shedding your ego — as you learn how to do this better.

It will require learning from others, undoing bad storytelling habits.

Keyphrase: best of your abilities.

It may mean writing about topics you’ve never considered ( I’m writing a piece on better decision making and scared shitless about how “unme” it sounds. I request feedback from a writing partner who knows more on the subject and his pointers were invaluable).

The price of being a better storyteller involves being willing to find your voice beyond the ego, beyond what you know to be “you”.

We’re all changing and the way we perceived “love” or “money’’ a few years — even months ago — isn’t the way we do now.

That story? That evolution you’ve achieved? That’s unique to you.

The world needs this story to know it’s possible to evolve.

You have no idea who is waiting on your story — the story only you could tell.

Don’t second guess yourself. Open that new document and start.

You have it in you to tell beautiful stories. I know this. You know this. You wouldn’t be fighting so hard to be better if you didn’t.

We want to hear from you — the story only you can tell. Because there’s no one who has lived the life you live.

Tap into that. Spend time with yourself. Practice more, try different things. Free yourself from the pain of tying your ego to any such feedback, use everything to grow and become a better storyteller.

Make A Plan for When You Want to Give Up Writing,"Find the Time to Write

I am an advocate for anyone being able to find the time to write. I even wrote a book on writing that included how to do this, and I have various articles talking about it, but wow, life seems to have got me this time. All my usual tricks aren’t working. I feel like I’m ready to give up and that maybe I’m just not cut out to be a working writer.

I’ve tried getting up at 5 am to write or working in the evening to get some words done. I’ve even taken up using dictation in hope to be able to get words on the go, but the more I do to enable myself a good amount of writing time, the harder life seems to make it for me actually to get to my desk.

If it isn’t dealing with ill-health of elderly family members and new babies being born into my family, it’s my children needing help with things in their life. I joke, to my friends who say they can’t wait for their children to grow up, that it gets worse. But it isn’t really a joke. Bigger kids means bigger problems.

I’m not complaining about these things. I care for my father’s mother. I cared for my father before he died. I have four children, they have their own children, and being a big family means we all muck in together to help each other out. It’s fantastic we have that family support, but it can’t half take my time up.

And let’s not forget that pandemic. I know my wife and I aren’t alone in how the pandemic has affected us. My wife runs a wedding business, and so with all weddings being cancelled, she’s had to find other work, and I’ve been needed to help with that.

Know What Your Audience Wants With Quality Market Research,"Have you ever published something and gotten a resounding echo in response? Nobody read your article, the editor rejected your book, or you sold one lonely e-book?

What went wrong? You thought your writing was interesting, structured properly, and your grammar was correct. I’ve had this happen, and it sucks!

I’ve learned to ask this essential question, “Why should my reader care about what I’ve written?”

The answer, “Because I think it’s good,” or “Because I think it’s funny, interesting, or educational,” won’t work.

Next question. “How do I discover what my reader cares about?”

Most of my writing is for business blogs and websites. I must know what my reader is interested in. If not, I’m wasting my time and my client’s hard-earned money.

There are tools you can use to find out what your reader wants, to understand what they crave, and get familiar with them. I will show you how to do just that.

This reader can be called a profile, a persona, or an avatar, but it’s an image of one person in your audience.

When you have a thorough understanding of who your reader is and what they hope to read, you will also be able to market to them — a huge bonus!

The vast majority of products are sold because of the need for love, the fear of shame, the pride of achievement, the drive for recognition, the yearning to feel important, the urge to look attractive, the lust for power, the longing for romance, the need to feel secure, the terror of facing the unknown, the lifelong hunger for self-esteem and so on. —Gary Bencivenga, legendary copywriter.

We won’t be successful if we make assumptions about our readers. We’ve got to know what problems they are trying to solve.

Here, I’ll use one of my own projects as an example.

Here are a few projects on my list.

I’m working on an informative blog post about gardening for Medium.

How to Start Your First Vegetable Garden, a full-length book.

Outline a 2,000-word article I hope to sell to Organic Gardening magazine.

A Texas seed company hired me to produce a 900-word piece on the best vegetable varieties for Central Texas.

I’m working on the beginning gardener book first since it requires the most research, and I can use what I learn for the other projects.

I need to get a clear picture of a typical reader for my book.

This will be a fictional composite person based on research. Think of it as developing a backstory, just as you would for a character in a novel.

So who would my imaginary gardener be?

Step # 1: I start with some simple Google searches for my high-level questions, including a date.

Google: Who spends the most money on gardening 2020?

I’m guessing that a group spending money on their hobby would be a likely buyer for my Basics of Starting Your First Vegetable Garden book.

As I scroll down and I see a comprehensive report titled 2020 National Gardening Survey. However, it costs $1200.00, more than I want to spend!

Next, I find an article titled State of the Industry 2020, published by Garden Center magazine. Not too many specifics here, but I note this promising statement, “With the resurgence of victory gardening in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and high unemployment rates, edibles saw the biggest growth this year.”

Google: What age are the people gardening at home?

An article titled Why the 20–30 Somethings Are Gardening tops the page.

“Although food gardening, in general, is up 17% in the past 5 years and still growing, the rate is up by 63% among ages 18–34, according to a new study by the National Gardening Association.”

I list points from the article:

These new gardeners are looking for ‘real’ and ‘non-virtual’ things in their lives.

They worry about the security of the food supply.

Gardening is a hobby to share with their children.

They have small yards and are interested in container gardening.

While interested in organic growing, they lose patience with complicated instructions.

This is beneficial information I can use!

I decide my new gardener is Ryan, 32 years old, and he works as a software developer.

Photo by Austin Paquette on Unsplash

Step # 2: Many big tech companies are downtown, so I imagine Ryan living within biking distance of downtown. I am familiar with a vegan restaurant in the area, and so I put him living in zip code 78704.

Enter the zip code at https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/ to pull up the basic demographic information.

Median household income of $51,00.00

Most people live in rental homes

84% single, 12% have children

Education level: 50% graduated college

Ryan rents a single-family house on Monroe St. with his friends Renae and Anthony.

Photo by Phil Hearing on Unsplash

Step # 3: Next, I go to the global demographic site, Esri. Fortunately, we can gain a lot of spending and lifestyle information from their free services.

Enter a zip code to get reports on area residents. They tell me that the three groups of residents in this area are the Young & Restless, Emerald City, and Metro Renters.

I decide Ryan fits in the Emerald City group, so I gather information from that report to combine with the other facts I’ve collected (and imagine) about him.

Ryan balances long hours on the computer with biking and working out at the gym. He embraces the ‘foodie’ culture and enjoys cooking adventurous meals using local and organic foods to share with his friends.

His slightly shabby rental house was built in 1946. The landlord lets Ryan have a garden in the backyard where he’s learning to grow vegetables for the first time. He enjoys growing things, but his plants aren’t producing too well.

All three of the roommates buy natural, green, and environmentally friendly products. They love learning new things to keep life interesting.

Ryan goes to lots of music shows, especially the big outdoor events in Austin. He likes living close to downtown, with the new library and Farmer’s Market.

Like most people his age, he looks for information on YouTube first. He posts on Instagram when the mood strikes but finds most social media boring.

He graduated from U.T. with a degree in computer engineering and hasn’t thought too seriously about getting married or having children.

Step # 4: Ryan’s gardening hopes and fears.

I need to find out what he hopes to gain from my book or article, what motivates him. At the same time, I’ll gain insight to help me market my book.

Social media makes it easy.

Facebook has groups about nearly everything. Join some groups in the same genre or subject as you write. Go to the group page, and with the ‘search’ function, look for questions people are asking.

For instance, on the Central Texas Vegetable Gardening page, I typed, “How do I ___?’

Questions include, ‘how do I prepare my soil? ‘when do I plant?’ ‘how much should I water? and ‘what about caterpillars?’

I also see people say things like, ‘I’m a newbie, so don’t laugh…’, ‘this is a dumb question…’, ‘it’s my first year…’. People are insecure, but they have lots of questions!

Quora is another place to see what questions people are asking in a more global audience. Questions include ‘how much room do I need to grow all my vegetables?’, ‘what are the easiest vegetables to grow?’, and ‘how do I grow bigger vegetables?’

If I’m stuck for questions, I can read Reddit, too. Again, just simple keywords like ‘grow, vegetables, problems’ can bring some leads.

Read an article like this one: Social Media Demographics, to find out where your typical reader spends time. Since YouTube is the top social media for Ryan, I check it out and find the top views on the subject are for Gardening 101 and A Complete Guide to Digging & Planting a Vegetable Garden.

Amazon book reviews can be incredible sources of insight.

Particularly, I am looking for the specific problems readers are attempting to solve. I take notes of the exact words they use as these will be valuable terms to include for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes.

I look for ‘Beginning Vegetable Gardening’ and read reviews of highly and poorly rated titles. It’s helpful to see what people find useful and what they don’t like.

Reviewers use words like precise, concise, easy-to-understand, good index, lots of pictures, and mention that one of the popular authors has a website and podcast, too.

Several readers mentioned that the book didn’t mention it was mainly for U.S. readers, and they were located in the U.K., making a lot of the text irrelevant.

Negatives include not being detailed enough for beginners and assuming that the reader had more prior experience than they did.

Forget your generalized audience. In the first place, the nameless, faceless audience will scare you to death and in the second place, unlike the theater, it doesn’t exist.

In writing, your audience is one single reader. I have found that sometimes it helps to pick out one person — a real person you know, or an imagined person and write to that one. — John Steinbeck

Step # 5: Ready to write

Hopefully, Ryan won’t be the only reader of my new book. I will make two more profiles for this book and keep all these people in mind as I write. I frequently visit new gardeners as a consultant, and that first-hand contact adds depth to my research.

Likely readers include Susan and Peter, a recently retired couple planning to start a garden. And Felicia has plans to move to a small farm in the country but is eager to learn garden skills.

This research tells me what Ryan, Susan, Peter, and Felicia hope to learn.

It will also give me ideas to develop my social media content calendar and to market my writing.

For instance, Ryan wants to grow some kick-ass vegetables to cook and impress his friends. He won’t spend all weekend gardening-he has other things to do. He’s looking for simple, straightforward information — hopefully with links to YouTube tutorials to clarify the tricky points.

He’ll lose interest if I geek out on Latin names for vegetables and a deep dive into soil science. K.I.S.S. is what I need to focus on. When I start going crazy with the details, thinking about Ryan helps me concentrate.

When I’m writing, I pinned my taped my reader avatar to the wall above my desk, so I’d remember to keep them in mind.

Ryan shops at the Farmer’s Market; perhaps I could sell books there to build some buzz. Would there be a way to tie into the huge techie community in Austin with cooking demonstrations with a popular vegan chef?

Coping With Cabin Fever,"We’re all on the inside looking out. Image courtesy of Joshua Rawson-Harris via Unsplash

I’ve had a lot of freedom in my life. I’ve traveled wherever my heart has desired near or far. I’ve gotten in car and just driven until everything I’ve known is but a distant dot in my rear view mirror. I’ve (literally and unfortunately) gotten lost in a Costa Rican rainforest. I’ve slept under the stars, in a dumpster (for science!), in a yurt, and even on a boat. I’m the Dr. Seuss of adventure.

I’m a free spirit, meant to roam this Earth.

When the pandemic started I knew it would be tough. I knew the brakes on all travel, even to the grocery store, would be severely limited. I wanted to, and still want to, do my part by practicing social distancing.

I am staying six-feet and more from everyone and most things I know and care about. Last week as I sat in my home office dressed in a bathing suit, a top knot bun, yoga pants, and body glitter, I realized — I may be experiencing a bit of the ol’ cabin fever.

“Cabin fever is a distressing claustrophobic irritability or restlessness experienced when a person is stuck at an isolated location or confined quarters for an extended period of time.” — Wikipedia

Distressed? Check. Irritable? Double check. Restlessness? Oh, yeah! Cabin fever is a state of mind. It’s a stranger than fiction combination of anxiety, boredom, edgy, irascibility that is sometimes hard to define, but you can feel it in every fiber of your being. Some of us are very social creatures and we work, think, act, and enjoy life better when we have contact with other people. If you are prone to intense bouts of anxiety, depression, or loneliness, the current state of things can turn a comical case of cabin fever into a serious saddlebag of negative consequences.

Cue the stress and welcome the effects that accompany this such as:

Feelings of hopelessness

Increase self doubt

Decrease self worth

Excess weight gain or loss

Inflammation (i.e. body aches and pains)

Weakened immune system

Fatigue and sleeping difficulties

Inability to focus or brain fog

…and much more

I’m not even getting into the domino effect that stress from loneliness and isolation can cause putting you at greater risk for more serious medical and emotional problems. In a time where sadly almost 9% — that’s 44 million — Americans have no health insurance. Plus an additional 38 million have what is described as ‘inadequate’ health insurance, you might not have the luxury of calling your therapist, scheduling extra sessions with your life coach, or reaching out to your primary physician to talk about medication options. You may feel like you appear to be doing ‘okay’ on the outside but aren’t feeling so great on the inside.

Stir-crazy like a baker’s mixer

The isolation and social distancing will hit us all differently, mind, body, and soul — but you can beat the blues before they beat you. I’ve found the following assorted ways have aided me in avoiding feeling like the walls are closing in (because they aren’t, I promise).

You are still adjusting to this new way of life

It’s important to maintain or build a comfortable level of social connections with the world and people around you. This goes doubly if you are living with mental or physical health issues. When you lack meaningful attachments, things can start to look and feel more bleak than they actually are.

Whatever you’re feeling may be in passing or may be lingering for months with no improvement. However, few simple lifestyle changes can combat cabin fever head on and while none of the above will completely eradicate your feelings of fatigue, loneliness, or social claustrophobia, it can help get you started in the right direction.",https://medium.com/the-innovation/coping-with-cabin-fever-57162f5d19d7,,2020-09-30 22:30:37.307000+00:00,"Self-awareness,Life Lessons,Mental Health,Life,Productivity"
Image Segmentation with Python,"Thresholding

In image processing, thresholding is the process of creating a binary image from a grayscale image. A binary image is one whose pixels can have only two values — 0 (black) or 255 (white).

In the simplest case of thresholding, you select a value as a threshold and any pixel above this value becomes white (255), while any below becomes black (0). Check out the OpenCV documentation for image thresholding for more types and the parameters involved.

thresh = [cv2.threshold(img, np.mean(img), 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)[1] for img in tqdm(gray)]

The first parameter passed to cv2.threshold() is the grayscale image to be converted, the second is the threshold value, the third is the value which will be assigned to the pixel if it crosses the threshold, and finally we have the type of thresholding.

cv2.threshold() returns two values, the first being an optimal threshold calculated automatically if you use cv2.THRESH_OTSU , and the second being the actual thresholded object. Since we’re only concerned about the object, we subscript [1] to append only the second returned value in our thresh list.

You can choose a static threshold, but then it won’t be able to take the different lighting conditions of different photos into account. I’ve chosen np.mean() , which gives the average value of a pixel for the image. Lighter images will have a value greater than 127.5 (255/2), while darker images will have a lower value. This lets you threshold images based on their lighting conditions.

For the first image, the threshold is 126.34, which means that the image is slightly darker than average. Any pixel which has a value greater than this will be converted to white, and any less, will be made black. But wait! If you notice the grayscale image, the leaf is darker than the background. If we apply a normal threshold, the darker pixels become black, while lighter pixels become white. This will apply a black mask on the leaf, not the background. To deal with this, we use the THRESH_BINARY_INV method, which inverts the thresholding process. Now, pixels having an intensity greater than the threshold will be made black — those with less, white.

Lets have a look at the pixel intensities for the first thresholded image:

As you can see, the pixels which were lighter (top row) in the grayscale array are now black, while those which were darker (bottom row), are now white.

Lets see the thresholded images to verify:",https://medium.com/better-programming/image-segmentation-python-7a838a464a84,Siddhant Sadangi,2020-08-18 06:57:35.820000+00:00,"Machine Learning,Python,Image Processing,Computer Vision,Programming"
Why Do I Feel Guilty When My Mental Health is Good?,"Much of my current writing efforts center around my experience dealing with my poor mental health. Even so, my personal health is not my niche. I like to think I spend most of my time being an advocate and talking about mental health in general. But I have to admit the most impactful stories I’ve written have been about times in my life where my mental illness got the best of me — whether it’s suicide, self-harm, or psychotic episodes.

Over my years of writing about these experiences, I’ve been thorough and have hardly left a stone unturned, so when I do feel like writing about my personal life, there aren’t many unique scary stories left. I try to avoid writing about the mundane details of everyday life — I blog on Facebook for that. I save my time here on Medium for the remarkable.

The thing that drives me now more than ever is my need to help others. The best way I know to help is to write about the experiences that shaped the person I am today. So, the point I’m getting to is if I run out of “material,” how am I going to continue to help people?

Is it weird that I feel guilty that more bad things aren’t happening to me so I can overcome them and write about it?

I’m all about honesty

I know you may be thinking I’m a writer — couldn’t I make up scenarios and create lessons around them, like Aesop’s Fables?

My answer is no. My whole persona, my voice, my relatability — is built on the fact that I’m honest about the things that happened to me in my life. I never embellish, and I never hold back important details, even if they are heartbreaking and embarrassing.

I know we should be adaptable and willing to change, but I’m not sure I can make an impact with stories I’m not 100% invested in. I can’t change who I am for views and reads. I know the purpose of the views and reads is to help people, but I’m so attached to helping people with my own experiences that it would feel like cheating if I made up stories.

Does that make any sense? I feel so strongly about connecting with others through my writing, and I wouldn’t want to do anything that would jeopardize not only the reader’s feelings toward me but my own opinion about myself.

Where do I go from here?

I’m going to keep writing about my life, and I’m sure that I’ll always be able to put a different spin on the story, but eventually, people are going to get tired of my talking about the voices I hear, my suicide attempts, and the years of depression and anxiety.

My recovery may be progressing faster than I’d imagined, so I can’t count on bad things to keep happening. Besides, feeling guilty for having good mental health is about the silliest thing I’ve ever heard from my mouth.

I only have the stories I have, and I’ll have to continue to find a way to use them to create articles and essays with the sole purpose of helping others. My job as a writer is to find unique ways to tie them together with my new stories of building a life after mental illness.

A different path

I’m unique in many ways. All ego aside, I know I have an interesting story to tell. I am a man who has made it through some of the hardest years anyone could have lived. I’m building a life despite being schizoaffective and hearing voices. I’ve learned to exist with an illness that most of the time will send the sufferer through a life of mental hospitals and debilitating medications.

I came back from almost ending my life and used my attempts as a catalyst to change everything about myself. I mutilated myself for years and now use my scars as a lesson to others that even if you hit bottom, you can still find your way out of the rabbit hole.

I’m on the road to better mental health, and it was a hard battle to get here. I’m sure the stories I live from here on out can also be used to help others as well.

I’m a brand-new father at 50 years old. I’m eight years into my forever-marriage, and every day sees me getting happier and more fulfilled. Despite what I’ve gone through, I’m a father, a husband, a son, an advocate, a writer, an entrepreneur, an influencer, and a damn-good human being.

Every day I walk a path to greater happiness, and I feel fulfilled by every little event in my life.

Writing about my life now has to be of help to someone out there. Someone out there is on the same path as I, hoping to connect with someone else who feels like they do and can relate to their story.

I may have the same old painful stories of the past, but my hopeful stories from my future will help just as much.",https://jasonjamesweiland.medium.com/why-do-i-feel-guilty-when-my-mental-health-is-good-c0417b92d15d,Jason Weiland,2020-02-13 03:43:12.976000+00:00,"Creativity,Mindfulness,Mental Health,Self,Writing"
10 Steps to Win with Blogging in 2021,"10 Steps to Win with Blogging in 2021

A no-stress guide

Photo by Markus Winkler on Unsplash

2021 is almost here and now is a good time to start a blog so that you can experience some success and make real money in the new year.

Many people choose blogging as their professional career and make a decent income doing it. Many newcomers consider blogging to be their professional career but don’t know the proper way to start making money.

However, if you want to start a blog, you have to go through the steps and do the work. And if you’re diligent your blog can perform well and earn more revenue with your blog. This article is about starting and running an effective blog business to earn a little more in 2021.

Here are the steps to start a blog and make money in 2021:

1. Choose a suitable niche

Before you plan to develop a blog, you should decide on the blog’s niche. At this stage, some research may be needed on the market/niche because domain knowledge is necessary to write and run a niche blog.

Several niches can be used for your blogs, but you should plan to choose just one that’s dear to your heart and interests. If you choose a competitive niche, then it can be difficult for you to rank on search engines against your peers. Don’t be afraid of this. Some of the more common niches are written as follows:

Fashion

Health & Fitness

Sports

Education

Technology

Marketing

News

2. Choose a conspicuous brand name for your blog

Blogging is a real business in which you invest your money, time, and effort. In this regard, you need to consider branding your blog by giving it a professional, creative name. A good name could attract the audience to read your blog when the name is discussed. Once you have selected the niche, you should focus on choosing the best name that fits your niche and attracts the attention of the user.

Remember that the name you select must be unique and interesting. Hopefully, the domain will be available for your blog that matches your desired blog name. Finally, the name should fully describe your brand and be inviting to your target demographic.

3. Buy a domain and hosting

The domain is the name used by users and search engines to recognize and access your blog while hosting is the server on which all your files are stored. There are thousands of domain registrars and website hosting companies.

The task is to find the best domain registrar and hosting provider because bad hosting will cause a lot of problems for your blog. The main concerns would be the speed and security of your blog. If your website’s page speed is not fast, search engines won’t rank your site higher than your competitors.

4. Choose a platform for your blog

Here are two ways to create your blog–use a content management system (CMS) and or code it from the ground up. If you know how to code, you can create your own blog, but it could be a complex and time-consuming to create an appealing blog this way.

The CMS is the most popular option and WordPress is the most commonly used CMS. WordPress is one of the best options for making your blog because it provides the themes and plugins that will help you develop and launch your site quickly. Besides, you can change the colors of your blog, header, footer, or add the post to WordPress quickly and very easily. If that’s not enough, WordPress is available on the cPanel of most web hosting platforms.

5. Customize your blog

In this step, you need to install a WordPress theme or develop it yourself. After that, you have to choose the colors you want for your blog and generally customize it. The best combination of colors increases the interest of readers. If you use WordPress, you can add neat widgets on your header, body, sidebar, and footers to improve user experience.

6. Create a content strategy

By this point, your blog’s done and the steps to operation and monetization begin! Now, you can create some of the effective strategies for the regular writing of your content. The content should be unique, informative, and inviting to the reader and if you are successful with your content strategy, your visitor will become loyal readers! In addition to writing, make strategies to organize your content with a content calendar, optimize your content, and share it via your social media channels. You won’t regret it.

Power tip: Use a duplicate content checker before publishing content from another writer on your blog.

7. Search Engine Optimization

To reach the top position on SERPs (search engine result pages), you should apply SEO optimization to your blog in the following ways:

On-Page SEO

Off-Page SEO

Technical SEO

Backlinking

Keyword research

Social Media Marketing

Search Engine Marketing

8. Apply for AdSense and other sources of income

There are many ways to earn money from your blog, including ads, affiliate marketing, sponsored posts, and event blogging. A couple of these options are briefly explained below:

Display Ads

The best-known brand for displaying the ads is Google AdSense, which pays you according to clicks and impressions on your website. You should apply after you have read the Terms of Use and after your blog is six months old. You can also apply for Ezoic after your website reaches 10,000 sessions per month or Mediavine after your blog reaches 50,000 sessions per month.

Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing is to sell someone’s product, but by displaying and discussing the product on your blog. If your site visitor buys a service or product after clicking an affiliate link on your blog, you will receive a commission under the agreement. Cha-ching! You can look into making an affiliate account with companies like Amazon and eBay.

9. Social Media Marketing

We all know the importance of social media in today’s world, and if you (or someone on your team) are not active on social media then you are missing a big opportunity to share your content. Your readers and competitors are on social media and you should be too.

10. Analytics

Analytics are kind of like having exam results year-round. Analytics helps you measure the success rate of your campaigns, whether on your blogging, link building, or social media marketing. Analytics help you to know the views, bounce rate, and session time of your website. If you’re not measuring your traffic via analytics then you don’t know where you stand. Don’t skip this last important step for starting a blog in 2021.

Use Google Analytics to track website analytics for your blog and Hotjar to track how visitors interact with your website. That’s it. No unnecessary conclusion needed. Get to work now by choosing your blog’s niche.",https://medium.com/inspirefirst/10-steps-to-win-with-blogging-in-2021-7c3b14a602fa,Christopher Luxe,2020-09-22 12:31:45.268000+00:00,"Marketing,Business,Blogging,Entrepreneurship,Writing"
An Introduction to t-SNE with Python Example,"Introduction

I’ve always had a passion for learning and consider myself a lifelong learner. Being at SAS, as a data scientist, allows me to learn and try out new algorithms and functionalities that we regularly release to our customers. Often times, the algorithms are not technically new, but they’re new to me which makes it a lot of fun.

Recently, I had the opportunity to learn more about t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). In this post I’m going to give a high-level overview of the t-SNE algorithm. I’ll also share some example python code where I’ll use t-SNE on both the Digits and MNIST dataset.

What is t-SNE?

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is an unsupervised, non-linear technique primarily used for data exploration and visualizing high-dimensional data. In simpler terms, t-SNE gives you a feel or intuition of how the data is arranged in a high-dimensional space. It was developed by Laurens van der Maatens and Geoffrey Hinton in 2008.

t-SNE vs PCA

If you’re familiar with Principal Components Analysis (PCA), then like me, you’re probably wondering the difference between PCA and t-SNE. The first thing to note is that PCA was developed in 1933 while t-SNE was developed in 2008. A lot has changed in the world of data science since 1933 mainly in the realm of compute and size of data. Second, PCA is a linear dimension reduction technique that seeks to maximize variance and preserves large pairwise distances. In other words, things that are different end up far apart. This can lead to poor visualization especially when dealing with non-linear manifold structures. Think of a manifold structure as any geometric shape like: cylinder, ball, curve, etc.

t-SNE differs from PCA by preserving only small pairwise distances or local similarities whereas PCA is concerned with preserving large pairwise distances to maximize variance. Laurens illustrates the PCA and t-SNE approach pretty well using the Swiss Roll dataset in Figure 1 [1]. You can see that due to the non-linearity of this toy dataset (manifold) and preserving large distances that PCA would incorrectly preserve the structure of the data.

Figure 1 — Swiss Roll Dataset. Preserve small distance with t-SNE (solid line) vs maximizing variance PCA [1]

How t-SNE works

Now that we know why we might use t-SNE over PCA, lets discuss how t-SNE works. The t-SNE algorithm calculates a similarity measure between pairs of instances in the high dimensional space and in the low dimensional space. It then tries to optimize these two similarity measures using a cost function. Let’s break that down into 3 basic steps.

1. Step 1, measure similarities between points in the high dimensional space. Think of a bunch of data points scattered on a 2D space (Figure 2). For each data point (xi) we’ll center a Gaussian distribution over that point. Then we measure the density of all points (xj) under that Gaussian distribution. Then renormalize for all points. This gives us a set of probabilities (Pij) for all points. Those probabilities are proportional to the similarities. All that means is, if data points x1 and x2 have equal values under this gaussian circle then their proportions and similarities are equal and hence you have local similarities in the structure of this high-dimensional space. The Gaussian distribution or circle can be manipulated using what’s called perplexity, which influences the variance of the distribution (circle size) and essentially the number of nearest neighbors. Normal range for perplexity is between 5 and 50 [2].

Figure 2 — Measuring pairwise similarities in the high-dimensional space

2. Step 2 is similar to step 1, but instead of using a Gaussian distribution you use a Student t-distribution with one degree of freedom, which is also known as the Cauchy distribution (Figure 3). This gives us a second set of probabilities (Qij) in the low dimensional space. As you can see the Student t-distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution. The heavy tails allow for better modeling of far apart distances.

Figure 3 — Normal vs Student t-distribution

3. The last step is that we want these set of probabilities from the low-dimensional space (Qij) to reflect those of the high dimensional space (Pij) as best as possible. We want the two map structures to be similar. We measure the difference between the probability distributions of the two-dimensional spaces using Kullback-Liebler divergence (KL). I won’t get too much into KL except that it is an asymmetrical approach that efficiently compares large Pij and Qij values. Finally, we use gradient descent to minimize our KL cost function.

Use Case for t-SNE

Now that you know how t-SNE works let’s talk quickly about where it is used. Laurens van der Maaten shows a lot of examples in his video presentation [1]. He mentions the use of t-SNE in areas like climate research, computer security, bioinformatics, cancer research, etc. t-SNE could be used on high-dimensional data and then the output of those dimensions then become inputs to some other classification model.

Also, t-SNE could be used to investigate, learn, or evaluate segmentation. Often times we select the number of segments prior to modeling or iterate after results. t-SNE can often times show clear separation in the data. This can be used prior to using your segmentation model to select a cluster number or after to evaluate if your segments actually hold up. t-SNE however is not a clustering approach since it does not preserve the inputs like PCA and the values may often change between runs so it’s purely for exploration.

Code Example

Below is some python code (Figures below with link to GitHub) where you can see the visual comparison between PCA and t-SNE on the Digits and MNIST datasets. I select both of these datasets because of the dimensionality differences and therefore the differences in results. I also show a technique in the code where you can run PCA prior to running t-SNE. This can be done to reduce computation and you’d typically reduce down to ~30 dimensions and then run t-SNE.

I ran this using python and calling the SAS libraries. It may appear slightly different than what you’re use to and you can see that in the images below. I used Seaborn for my visuals which I thought was great, but with t-SNE you may get really compact clusters and need to zoom in. Another visualization tool, like Plotly, may be better if you need to zoom in or manipulate your plot object. Also, a simple %matplotlib notebook call before you plots works as well assuming your using Matplotlib.

Researchers created an invisibility cloak from this ‘artificial skin’,"7TH ARMY JOINT MULTINATIONAL TRAINING — COMMAND/VICTOR TANGERMANN

FUTURISTIC INVENTION

Researchers created an invisibility cloak from this ‘artificial skin’

Mimicking the color and temperature of their environment, this novel tech can make soldiers ‘invisible’

Cloaking devices from the yesteryears Scifi show ‘Star Trek’ are now becoming a reality. A lot of research has been undertaken in this area recently. For now, most of these applications are being developed for specific use cases like the one we are going to discuss today — giving soldiers the ability to blend in with their natural surroundings.

Back in 2019, I wrote about a Canadian biotech company, Hyperstealth Biotechnology Corp. which reached the patent application stage with its light-bending, paper-thin & inexpensive futuristic material — making things invisible behind it. Their prototype “Quantum Stealth” material was also developed for military purposes.

While the Canadian company used a paper-thin material to develop the invisibility cloak, South Korean researchers have taken this to the next level by developing an “artificial skin” that could allow soldiers to perfectly blend in with their surroundings. The resulting cloak not only makes them invisible to regular cameras but also to infrared-based night vision as well.

Although the novel tech sounds futuristic and out of a sci-fi movie, there are examples of this in nature — like the chameleon’s ability to blend into the surroundings. This invention just takes this natural cloaking ability from the visible light spectrum to the next step by masking the heat signature of the wearer as well.

“The cloaking in the visible range is therefore achieved separately by matching the ambient color… we recently developed a method to detect and mimic the environment by integrating a micro camera with our devices to make an autonomously working device.” ~ Seung Hwan Ko, Team Lead

According to the research, it uses flexible patches that can camouflage itself and is capable of cooling down or heating up depending on its surrounding environment.

4 positive steps to regain your creative confidence

Photo by Bernard Hermant on Unsplash

When constantly working in groups, it is easy to doubt your creative potential, as all your ideas are usually inspired by the ideas of others.

You may even think that you are unable to innovate on your own without group consultation.

But while the value of collective thinking is certain, human projects have always been fueled by individual brains. Your neurons make more unexpected connections than your meetings will ever do.

And the more you lose confidence in your creative potential, the more you will lose this intellectual energy.

How to recover your creative confidence to illuminate your projects with original ideas?

According to David and Tom Kelley in Creative Confidence, you can regain your belief in your creativity by forcing yourself into new experiences.

The most creative professionals have learned to reflect on their “creativity scars’’, reappropriating their self-mastery, embracing their mistakes, and creating in more visual and playful ways.

Using their examples, here are 4 steps to put a spark of creativity back in your projects and take them in hand.

1. Reflecting on Your Creativity Scars

When it comes to being creative, you may find yourself thinking that it’s not for you and that others are better at it than you are…

But being creative is natural, as shown by children’s innate ability to try and experiment with new things, and to use effortlessly their imaginations.

Your attitude of self-doubt, however, is not. It often comes from moments during your childhood when certain people have denied your creativity: the art teacher or friends who have denied the talent of your collages, drawings, photos…

Some people may have been a bad influence, making you lose your belief in the power of your imagination, and suggesting that creativity belongs exclusively to real artists and dreamers.

To change your views, remember the times during your education when your talents as a singer, painter, writer were denied. Analyze how they have taken you away from your passions for creative activities (drawing, acting, singing…).

Successful musicians like Paul McCartney and George Harrison of the Beatles were in music class together in high school, with a teacher who didn’t even recognize their talent and gave them no encouragement. Two decades later they were part of one of the most beloved bands of the 20th century.

That gives you something to put into perspective!

2. Regaining a Sense of Self-Mastery

When you try to test again your creative abilities, you may wonder where to start. You may fear that your actions will have no impact on your environment.

To dispel that doubt, you need to regain a sense of self-efficiency in your actions, by embarking on step-by-step experimentations.

For example, the famous social psychologist Albert Bandura has used an innovative method to help his patients confront their phobia of snakes: through trials that brought them closer and closer to the sight and touch of a snake.

It started by getting closer behind a door, listening to their sound, looking at them in a mirror, and then touching them. This process allowed them to overcome their fear by acting little by little on it, gaining more control over it.

A few months later, these same patients had learned to overcome their fear and problem by taking the initiative and using their creativity to gradually take control of their problem. They had also learned the belief that they could change something that seemed insurmountable at the time by taking action if only a little.

In the same way, you need to start with small actions to overcome your fear of being judged and your doubts. This will allow you to regain your self-mastery when it comes to using your creativity.

3. Owning Your Failures

One of the other essential keys to unlocking your creativity is to learn to accept your mistakes and even to seek out more and more of them.

The greatest innovators like Thomas Edison or the Wright Brothers have been as creative by having the ability and the environment to engage in broad and constant experimentation.

You may need to assimilate this optimism taught by video games, that behind your failures progress and success are never too far away.

It is a question of creating such a “virtual” environment around you, which makes you want to test your creative abilities where no one judges you and you don’t fear losing something.

For example, a juggling teacher has taught his students to accept their mistakes by starting his classes with “ball drop sessions”: the goal is to throw their balls and let them fall each time. This exercise reduces the pressure on new students and makes them take risks, as they usually tend to avoid dropping their balls at all costs.

In the same way, rediscovering activities with fewer stakes, such as writing in a diary, drawing at home, finding artistic hobbies you have given up for a while (theatre, acting,) are all solutions to regain confidence in your creativity. It enables you to experiment with your creative talents without doubting yourself too much.

They let you make your mistakes and teach you their creative value.

4. Creating in a More Visual and Playful Way

When you try to put a creative impulse into your projects, you may wonder what you may change first, and even if a change is really necessary.

You may be paralyzed by your perfectionism, as you don’t want to present ideas outside of your area of expertise or change your plans too abruptly.

But you don’t need to put too much pressure on you.

To add a creative touch, sometimes simple and playful means are enough: drawings, maps, and diagrams help you redesign your decisions and the situation of your projects.

Dan Roam, an expert in the art of visual thinking, insists that anyone can draw anything — even if they don’t feel naturally creative or gifted — just by deconstructing it into 5 basic shapes: a circle, a line, a square, a triangle, and an irregular shape.

Starting from these shapes, you can describe new emotions, relationships, and ideas on a board, and reconsider the scheme of your projects in new ways. You can retrace the arguments for your decisions, renew the presentation of your figures, reconsider the emotions of your clients with the help of a simple pencil.

All this without having to bother being a professional painter or drawer: only by making visual and natural creativity work!",https://medium.com/thinking-up/you-dont-need-others-to-feel-creative-8318ec1e939c,Jean-Marc Buchert,2020-07-10 10:23:53.553000+00:00,"Self-awareness,Productivity,Creativity,Self Confidence,Self Improvement"
How Covid-19 May Affect the Brain’s Dopamine and Serotonin Levels,"How Covid-19 May Affect the Brain’s Dopamine and Serotonin Levels

This could be why 18% of Covid-19 survivors had psychiatric diagnoses, a population-sized study finds.

Adapted from Medical vector created by freepik — www.freepik.com

In April, a research review with an interesting title was published: “Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19? Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms.” This review draws on past pandemics and epidemics to infer what might happen following the Covid-19 pandemic, which a wave of psychiatric maladies.

Fast-forward today, we may finally see that wave. A paper published this month in The Lancet Psychiatry found that 18% of Covid-19 survivors — regardless of hospitalization status — develop psychiatric disorders within 14 to 90 days of infection. Considering the pandemic scale that has exceeded 57 million cases and 1.3 million deaths, 18% is huge.

What the study did and found

Using the TriNetX Analytics Network that stores health data of nearly 70 million patients across 54 healthcare organizations in the U.S., researchers at the University of Oxford identified 62,354 cases of Covid-19 as of August.

The study controlled for 50 covariates that may influence the results, which include age, sex, race, socioeconomic factors, nicotine dependence, and comorbidities (kidney, liver, heart and lung diseases, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and psoriasis).

“People have been worried that Covid-19 survivors will be at greater risk of mental health problems, and our findings … show this to be likely.”

After adjusting for covariates, they found 18% of Covid-19 survivors received a psychiatry diagnosis within 14 to 90 days of infection, of whom 5.8% had no history of psychiatric disorder. These 18% and 5.8% rates translate to a 1.5- to 2-times increased rate of recurrent and first-time diagnoses, respectively, compared to groups with a non-Covid health event — such as influenza, other respiratory infections, skin infections, gallstones, kidney stones, and bone fracture. Anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and insomnia were the most common diagnoses.

Even in Covid-19 cases that do not require hospital care, the risk of psychiatric aftermath remains 1.5–2-times higher. “The elevated risk of psychiatric sequelae after Covid-19 diagnosis compared with control health events could not be readily explained by differences in illness severity,” the authors wrote, although a modest dose-dependent relationship seems to exist. However, I would keep an open mind until further studies replicate the findings that even mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 would affect a person’s mental health.

“People have been worried that Covid-19 survivors will be at greater risk of mental health problems, and our findings … show this to be likely,” Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford who directed the study, stated.

The study also found that a history of psychiatric disorder led to a 1.6-times increased risk of positive Covid-19 diagnosis. Indeed, pre-existing psychiatric disorders do count as comorbidities that up the risk of more severe Covid-19. “Having a psychiatric disorder should be added to the list of risk factors for Covid-19,” said the study’s lead author, Max Taquet, Ph.D., a psychiatry researcher.

Thus, in this study, the diagnosed depression and anxiety cases may not be as severe as to qualify as major depression or anxiety disorders.

As with any studies, results must be interpreted in light of the study caveats. For one, despite already accounting for 50 covariates, the authors admitted that overlooked covariate may still be present. The geographical limitation to the U.S. only is also another drawback. Specifics about the psychiatric diagnoses were also lacking, such as severity or diagnostic criteria, which is a serious limitation that may undermine the study.

James C. Coyne, a health psychology professor at the University Medical Center Groningen, critiqued that the pandemic’s front liners may not have made diagnoses as accurately as a psychiatrist. A structured psychiatric interview, he said, usually takes 30 to 90 minutes, which is overly time-consuming at a massive scale. Thus, in this study, the diagnosed depression and anxiety cases may not be as severe as to qualify as major depression or anxiety disorders.

Biomolecular underpinnings

Let’s assume Covid-19 survivors indeed have a 1.5–2-times increased rate of future psychiatric diagnoses than survivors of other health events (e.g., influenza, gallstones, skin infection, etc.). Why is Covid-19 more strongly linked to psychiatry than other health events?

Part I: ACE2/DDC pathway

ACE2 is the receptor SARS-CoV-2 (that causes Covid-19) uses to enter cells. ACE2 co-expresses and co-regulates with dopa decarboxylase (DDC), an enzyme that makes serotonin and dopamine — neurochemicals involved in depression and anxiety. Upon cell infection, SARS-CoV-2 engulfs the ACE2 receptor, which lowers ACE2 expression on the cell. This decreases DDC expression as well, halting the production of dopamine and serotonin.

“Hence, a SARS-CoV-2- induced defective expression of ACE2 might be paralleled by a DDC dysfunction, with consequent potentially altered neurotransmitters’ levels in Covid‐19 patients,” stated a paper published last month in the European Journal of Psychiatry.

Recall that SARS-CoV-2 lowers ACE2 expression. The normal function of ACE2 is to convert angiotensin II to angiotensin 1–7. Therefore, if ACE2 decreases, angiotensin II would increase. And the problem is that angiotensin II promotes depression and anxiety as angiotensin II initiates a cascade of reactions leading to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.

The propensity to target the ACE2 receptor — in addition to cytokine storm induction — may be why SARS-CoV-2 is a greater risk factor for psychiatric aftermath than other health events such as influenza or skin infection.

Part II: TRP/KYN pathway

The tryptophan/kynurenine (TRP/KYN) pathway is one of the best-studied pathways in depression and anxiety. As tryptophan crosses the blood-brain-barrier to turn into serotonin, the TRP/KYN pathway strongly influences the brain’s serotonin levels.

This pathway starts when pro-inflammatory cytokines activate an enzyme called indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1). IDO-1 degrades TRP into KYN to suppress inflammation. As TRP is lost, serotonin production is compromised. And since IDO-1 is present in many organs, including the brain, systemic inflammation would lead to a system-wide decrease in serotonin levels.

“All of these pathways raise the possibility of patients affected by severe Covid-19 with prolonged exposure to inflammation, may have long-term neurological sequels,” wrote a research review published this month in The Neuroscientist that highlights the TRP/KYN pathway in Covid-depression.

Short abstract

Covid-19 survivors are at 2- and 1.5-times increased rate of recurrent and first-time psychiatric diagnoses, respectively, compared to survivors of non-Covid health events (e.g., influenza, skin infections, gallstones, etc.). Indeed, 18% of Covid-19 survivors had psychiatric aftermath — most commonly anxiety, depression, and insomnia — of which 5.8% were first-time diagnoses. The propensity to target the ACE2 receptor — in addition to cytokine storm induction— may be why SARS-CoV-2 is a greater risk factor for psychiatric aftermath than other health events.

Yet there’s the critique that diagnoses made by the Lancet study may not be as accurate as a psychiatrist's. The study may have diagnosed depression and anxiety that may not qualify as severe major depression or anxiety disorders. Thus, there may not be a wave of serious psychiatric disorders, but a mental health one. Indeed, coupled with income loss, bereavement, and social isolation, mental health crisis may be at an all-time high.",https://shinjieyong.medium.com/how-covid-19-may-affect-the-brains-dopamine-and-serotonin-levels-245c2d09be6d,Shin Jie Yong,2020-11-24 09:24:17.319000+00:00,"Mental Health,Ideas,Life,Science,Coronavirus"
"Coronavirus May Be a Vascular Disease, Which Explains Everything","Covid-19 May Be a Blood Vessel Disease, Which Explains Everything

Many of the infection’s bizarre symptoms have one thing in common

Image: MR.Cole_Photographer/Getty Images

In April, blood clots emerged as one of the many mysterious symptoms attributed to Covid-19, a disease that had initially been thought to largely affect the lungs in the form of pneumonia. Quickly after came reports of young people dying due to coronavirus-related strokes. Next it was Covid toes — painful red or purple digits.

What do all of these symptoms have in common? An impairment in blood circulation. Add in the fact that 40% of deaths from Covid-19 are related to cardiovascular complications, and the disease starts to look like a vascular infection instead of a purely respiratory one.

Months into the pandemic, there is now a growing body of evidence to support the theory that the novel coronavirus can infect blood vessels, which could explain not only the high prevalence of blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks, but also provide an answer for the diverse set of head-to-toe symptoms that have emerged.

“All these Covid-associated complications were a mystery. We see blood clotting, we see kidney damage, we see inflammation of the heart, we see stroke, we see encephalitis [swelling of the brain],” says William Li, MD, president of the Angiogenesis Foundation. “A whole myriad of seemingly unconnected phenomena that you do not normally see with SARS or H1N1 or, frankly, most infectious diseases.”

“If you start to put all of the data together that’s emerging, it turns out that this virus is probably a vasculotropic virus, meaning that it affects the [blood vessels],” says Mandeep Mehra, MD, medical director of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center.

In a paper published in April in the scientific journal The Lancet, Mehra and a team of scientists discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect the endothelial cells that line the inside of blood vessels. Endothelial cells protect the cardiovascular system, and they release proteins that influence everything from blood clotting to the immune response. In the paper, the scientists showed damage to endothelial cells in the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, and intestines in people with Covid-19.

“The concept that’s emerging is that this is not a respiratory illness alone, this is a respiratory illness to start with, but it is actually a vascular illness that kills people through its involvement of the vasculature,” says Mehra.

A respiratory virus infecting blood cells and circulating through the body is virtually unheard of.

A one-of-a-kind respiratory virus

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to enter the body through ACE2 receptors present on the surface of cells that line the respiratory tract in the nose and throat. Once in the lungs, the virus appears to move from the alveoli, the air sacs in the lung, into the blood vessels, which are also rich in ACE2 receptors.

“[The virus] enters the lung, it destroys the lung tissue, and people start coughing. The destruction of the lung tissue breaks open some blood vessels,” Mehra explains. “Then it starts to infect endothelial cell after endothelial cell, creates a local immune response, and inflames the endothelium.”

A respiratory virus infecting blood vessel cells and circulating through the body is virtually unheard of. Influenza viruses like H1N1 are not known to do this, and the original SARS virus, a sister coronavirus to the current infection, did not spread past the lung. Other types of viruses, such as Ebola or Dengue, can damage endothelial cells, but they are very different from viruses that typically infect the lungs.

Benhur Lee, MD, a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says the difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 likely stems from an extra protein each of the viruses requires to activate and spread. Although both viruses dock onto cells through ACE2 receptors, another protein is needed to crack open the virus so its genetic material can get into the infected cell. The additional protein the original SARS virus requires is only present in lung tissue, but the protein for SARS-CoV-2 to activate is present in all cells, especially endothelial cells.

“In SARS1, the protein that’s required to cleave it is likely present only in the lung environment, so that’s where it can replicate. To my knowledge, it doesn’t really go systemic,” Lee says. “[SARS-CoV-2] is cleaved by a protein called furin, and that’s a big danger because furin is present in all our cells, it’s ubiquitous.”

Endothelial damage could explain the virus’ weird symptoms

An infection of the blood vessels would explain many of the weird tendencies of the novel coronavirus, like the high rates of blood clots. Endothelial cells help regulate clot formation by sending out proteins that turn the coagulation system on or off. The cells also help ensure that blood flows smoothly and doesn’t get caught on any rough edges on the blood vessel walls.

“The endothelial cell layer is in part responsible for [clot] regulation, it inhibits clot formation through a variety of ways,” says Sanjum Sethi, MD, MPH, an interventional cardiologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “If that’s disrupted, you could see why that may potentially promote clot formation.”

Endothelial damage might account for the high rates of cardiovascular damage and seemingly spontaneous heart attacks in people with Covid-19, too. Damage to endothelial cells causes inflammation in the blood vessels, and that can cause any plaque that’s accumulated to rupture, causing a heart attack. This means anyone who has plaque in their blood vessels that might normally have remained stable or been controlled with medication is suddenly at a much higher risk for a heart attack.

“Inflammation and endothelial dysfunction promote plaque rupture,” Sethi says. “Endothelial dysfunction is linked towards worse heart outcomes, in particular myocardial infarction or heart attack.”

Blood vessel damage could also explain why people with pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease are at a higher risk for severe complications from a virus that’s supposed to just infect the lungs. All of those diseases cause endothelial cell dysfunction, and the additional damage and inflammation in the blood vessels caused by the infection could push them over the edge and cause serious problems.

The theory could even solve the mystery of why ventilation often isn’t enough to help many Covid-19 patients breathe better. Moving air into the lungs, which ventilators help with, is only one part of the equation. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood is just as important to provide the rest of the body with oxygen, and that process relies on functioning blood vessels in the lungs.

“If you have blood clots within the blood vessels that are required for complete oxygen exchange, even if you’re moving air in and out of the airways, [if] the circulation is blocked, the full benefits of mechanical ventilatory support are somewhat thwarted,” says Li.

A new paper published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, on which Li is a co-author, found widespread evidence of blood clots and infection in the endothelial cells in the lungs of people who died from Covid-19. This was in stark contrast to people who died from H1N1, who had nine times fewer blood clots in the lungs. Even the structure of the blood vessels was different in the Covid-19 lungs, with many more new branches that likely formed after the original blood vessels were damaged.

“We saw blood clots everywhere,” Li says. “We were observing virus particles filling up the endothelial cell like filling up a gumball machine. The endothelial cell swells and the cell membrane starts to break down, and now you have a layer of injured endothelium.”

Finally, infection of the blood vessels may be how the virus travels through the body and infects other organs — something that’s atypical of respiratory infections.

“Endothelial cells connect the entire circulation [system], 60,000 miles worth of blood vessels throughout our body,” says Li. “Is this one way that Covid-19 can impact the brain, the heart, the Covid toe? Does SARS-CoV-2 traffic itself through the endothelial cells or get into the bloodstream this way? We don’t know the answer to that.”

In another paper that looked at nearly 9,000 people with Covid-19, Mehra showed that the use of statins and ACE inhibitors were linked to higher rates of survival.

If Covid-19 is a vascular disease, the best antiviral therapy might not be antiviral therapy

An alternative theory is that the blood clotting and symptoms in other organs are caused by inflammation in the body due to an over-reactive immune response — the so-called cytokine storm. This inflammatory reaction can occur in other respiratory illnesses and severe cases of pneumonia, which is why the initial reports of blood clots, heart complications, and neurological symptoms didn’t sound the alarm bells. However, the magnitude of the problems seen with Covid-19 appear to go beyond the inflammation experienced in other respiratory infections.

“There is some increased propensity, we think, of clotting happening with these [other] viruses. I think inflammation in general promotes that,” Sethi says. “Is this over and above or unique for SARS-CoV-2, or is that just because [the infection] is just that much more severe? I think those are all really good questions that unfortunately we don’t have the answer to yet.”

Anecdotally, Sethi says the number of requests he received as the director of the pulmonary embolism response team, which deals with blood clots in the lungs, in April 2020 was two to three times the number in April 2019. The question he’s now trying to answer is whether that’s because there were simply more patients at the hospital during that month, the peak of the pandemic, or if Covid-19 patients really do have a higher risk for blood clots.

“I suspect from what we see and what our preliminary data show is that this virus has an additional risk factor for blood clots, but I can’t prove that yet,” Sethi says.

The good news is that if Covid-19 is a vascular disease, there are existing drugs that can help protect against endothelial cell damage. In another New England Journal of Medicine paper that looked at nearly 9,000 people with Covid-19, Mehra showed that the use of statins and ACE inhibitors were linked to higher rates of survival. Statins reduce the risk of heart attacks not only by lowering cholesterol or preventing plaque, they also stabilize existing plaque, meaning they’re less likely to rupture if someone is on the drugs.

“It turns out that both statins and ACE inhibitors are extremely protective on vascular dysfunction,” Mehra says. “Most of their benefit in the continuum of cardiovascular illness — be it high blood pressure, be it stroke, be it heart attack, be it arrhythmia, be it heart failure — in any situation the mechanism by which they protect the cardiovascular system starts with their ability to stabilize the endothelial cells.”

Mehra continues, “What we’re saying is that maybe the best antiviral therapy is not actually an antiviral therapy. The best therapy might actually be a drug that stabilizes the vascular endothelial. We’re building a drastically different concept.”

We need a reset on how we think about the future — even with Biden and Harris in the White House,"We need a reset on how we think about the future — even with Biden and Harris in the White House

Despite their monumental victory, president-elect Joe Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris have their work cut out to ensure the future is as vibrant, just and sustainable as possible

Photo by Tabrez Syed on Unsplash

As news agencies across the US declared former vice president Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 presidential election on Saturday, a tsunami of hope swept across the country. Yet as the incoming administration sets about trying to build a better future, it faces a monumental task.

The past four years have brought us closer than ever to the edge of a future that is in danger of crumbling beneath our feet; not just through the lying, the conspiracy theories and the blatant disregard for evidence, reason and basic human rights, but through a confluence of factors that are threatening to undermine our very ability to create the type of future we aspire to.

With coronavirus continuing to kill thousands of people each day and infect hundreds of thousands more, we’re being starkly reminded of how hard it is to simply “science” our way out of complex challenges. Yet the cracks at our metaphorical feet as we stand on the edge of tomorrow are as much a product of our social, political and technological behaviors as they are our science.

More than ever it seems, we’re indulging our baser instincts to ignore the evidence in front of us and marginalize and persecute those who don’t look and think like us on a grand scale. Whether this is manifest in extremism, nationalism, or a self-righteous dismissal of “wrong-thinkers” — meaning, simply, people who don’t share our worldview — it is becoming harder to work together toward building a better future.

And to top it all, we’re becoming so wrapped up in our capacity to innovate that we’re losing any semblance of ability to make smart choices between what we can do, and what we should — either as individuals, as communities and organizations, or as a society.

These are all symptomatic of deeper tensions between our collective ability to influence and change the future, and our capacity to do this effectively. And they are tensions that we will only be able to address through re-evaluating our relationship with the future, and our responsibility to it.

Re-evaluating our Relationship with the Future

My work cuts across multiple areas of expertise and practice to better understand the complex relationship between past and future. And as it does, I’m constantly reminded of how hard it is to ensure that social, technological and political advances don’t end up causing more harm than good.

Climate change, as its driven along by our technological recklessness, is a stark reminder of this. But so are the injustices that millions of people face every day that result from ill-considered political decisions, or poorly thought-through good intentions, or even technologies that threaten what is of value to them in the name of progress.

Unfortunately, while we can recode DNA, design new materials atom by atom, and create machines that may one day surpass human intelligence, we are still remarkably adept as a species at preventing all too many people from reaching the futures they aspire to.

Because of this, if we are to learn to use our immense capabilities more responsibly — and avoid potentially catastrophic failures arising from our short-sightedness — we need to better-understand our relationship with the future, and our individual and collective roles in ensuring that what comes next is better than the past.

As with human relationships, this will not be easy. Yet if we better-understand how the intertwined threads that define who we are come together to make us supremely talented architects of the future, we can learn how to become better architects of that future.

Escaping the Shackles of Conventional Thinking

These threads reflect our imagination, our understanding, and our inventiveness. But they also encapsulate our very humanity — our beliefs, our desires, our joys and our fears, our eccentricities and irrationalities, and our ability to see and feel the world through the eyes of others.

The very complexity of how these threads surround, intersect with and influence one another creates vulnerabilities that are near-impossible to see through the lens of conventional thinking.

To navigate this landscape, we need to be bold enough to depart from conventional ways of understanding the world. This will include learning how to be informed by disciplines without being bound by them, and becoming skilled at blending and leverage expertise in novel ways. It will also mean embracing creativity, playfulness and serendipity, as we open ourselves to new ideas and opportunities.

At the same time, we need to infuse our thinking and actions with a level of humility and care for others that, too often, seems to elude us.

Only by doing this will we be able to avoid the pitfalls of the past and see ways forward to building a vibrant and just future that is resilient, agile, and full of promise.

A Pathway Forward

As the Biden/Harris team prepares to enter the White House, this is perhaps one of the largest challenges they will face.

Of course, cleaning up the chaos of the past four years, finding a pathway to a post-coronavirus future, and placing the US on an economically and environmentally sustainable footing, are all critically important short-term goals. Yet even these will not be possible without pressing the reset button on how we think about the future, and our relationship with it.

With new leadership, new ideas, and a new respect for the people and society they serve, I sincerely hope that the Biden/Harris administration will rise to the challenge of pressing this reset button and rethinking our relationship with the future.

If they do, there’s every chance that we’ll have new opportunities to work together toward a future that is more just, more vibrant, and more sustainable — for everyone, not just a privileged few.",https://medium.com/edge-of-innovation/we-need-a-reset-on-how-we-think-about-the-future-even-with-biden-and-harris-in-the-white-house-8804510d6b45,Andrew Maynard,2020-11-08 00:11:00.943000+00:00,"Society,Technology,Future,Science,Election 2020"

Dudes in suits want to know the secret to social media so they can make money from it. Their intention is selfish, which is part of the problem.

How do we get customers?

What’s our story?

Write Because You Must,"Write Because You Must

Every other reason is secondary

Ask a thousand writers why they write, and you’ll hear plenty of varying answers. Among them will be terms like “side hustle” and “to help others.” But there’s really only one reason to put pen to paper — ehh, fingertips to letter keys — because you must.

I started Write, I Must to arm passionate storytellers with insights and tools they need and as a place for writers with others who feel the same need to get words out of their heads. There are thousands of books on the art of writing. Still, growth happens when we get rejected, figure out what went wrong, rework if necessary, and resubmit.

Confession: I get just as much out of publication as the readers. Tom Beck’s 7 Benefits of Writing by Hand reminds me of my college days when penning on paper was essential during the creative and editing process. Paper and ink were expensive, and retyping stories over and over exhausting.

As a former journalist, reading Cody Wiesner’s argument against the inverted pyramid was eye-opening. Side-note: journalistic writing styles aren’t just for reporters.

Then there’s Toni Koraza — who goes against the grain in explaining why writers don’t need their own website. I have one, but it’s for my professional services. I never write stories there.

There is a wealth of information to be learned not just from the “masters” who’ve been published by some of the largest outlets but also from those who are still finding their way to the top. We read not only to understand what editors want and how we should embrace rejection but also to learn from others’ mistakes.

The most genuine writers aren’t solely looking for a paycheck. They write because they have no other option, even if it means only one person reads their work to the end. They’re motivated by claps and comments, yet don’t let these numbers define them. They write because they love the game.

Because this does not comply with something deep within you, your interest will lag and eventually the money will not come so easily. You will search for other easy sources of money, moving further and further away from your path. Not seeing clearly ahead of you, you will end up in a dead-end career. Even if your material needs are met, you will feel an emptiness inside that you will need to fill with any kind of belief system, drugs, or diversions.

"Supreme, Wegmans and the benefits of resisting greed for your own good","At first glance they have nothing in common: a streetwear brand worn by hypebeasts around the world and a regional supermarket that started in Upstate New York.

But Supreme and Wegmans both inspire fanatical loyalty. And the way they do this is not complicated — they share value.

Supreme shares value with their customers, while Wegmans shares value with its employees. And by doing this, both have created businesses that are hugely successful and have kept up impressive growth without watering down their brands.

But why is it that others are not able to take inspiration from these examples?

One word: greed.

Companies agonize over optimizing pricing to get the absolute maximum that customers are willing to pay for a product at a given time. Think about airlines that are constantly changing prices to get the maximum from each individual passenger depending on how desperate they are to get somewhere.

While at the same time, when it comes to employees, most companies are trying to optimize for something different. They want to pay as little as possible while still being competitive enough in the marketplace that they won’t lose all of their employees.

But here’s the difference:

Supreme could raise their prices, but they don’t

Wegmans doesn’t have to offer such a good salary and benefits package to be “on market” for a supermarket, but they do it anyway

If you are building a business you would be wise to keep their examples in mind and resist greed for your own good.

Supreme “drops” leave value for their customers (and the resellers)

For those who are not familiar with the brand Supreme, it is an apparel company that sells in small batches of very limited editions called “drops” that create massive lines at their stores. These drops operate on a first-come, first-served basis and all of the most in-demand products are quick to sell out.

This has created a whole second-hand ecosystem of re-sellers who make a business out of waiting in these lines and getting the best stuff. They can then immediately re-sell the items at markups sometimes greater than 1000%.

Yes, that is not a typo — some items really do resell for 1000%.

For somebody who’s not reselling and just goes to the drops to shop for themselves, they feel like they got a great deal and it’s true: Supreme sold them something that is now worth multiples of what they just paid! And since they are so excited about this great deal, they will share their experience on social media and generate even more hype for the next drop.

Now here’s where the greed kicks in for any normal company. Most executives would look at that secondary market and say:

That 1000% markup is money that we are leaving on the table. We should raise our prices and capture that revenue for ourselves!

But you know what happens when you take that value from the resellers and put it in your own pocket?

Your products no longer sell-out immediately

You lose the long lines at your stores for the drops that create exclusivity

And you become just any other brand

Supreme shares a lot of value with customers, so they feel like they’re always getting a good deal. And this in turn creates more demand and a bigger reseller market with higher second-hand prices.

As long as this cycle is feeding itself Supreme knows they will always have a line outside their stores.

Of course there are now other brands like H&M trying to copy the drop strategy, but most won’t be successful because they just won’t be willing to give away so much value.

Or in the words of one Supreme reseller:

“If you are flash-dropping crap, it’s still crap.”

The key is not really the drop, it’s about sharing value.

Wegmans (actually) values its employees

Wegmans doesn’t have the global reach that Supreme does, but their customers are just as fanatically loyal.

In fact, Business Insider just reported how Wegmans is America’s favorite grocery store and that thousands of people call them every year begging them to open a store in their area.

And when asked about the secret to their success, Wegmans has a simple response that they gave in this Forbes article:

It is our employees, and the incredible service they provide our customers, that set us apart. We hire the best, and we invest in training and development,

There are no shortage of companies out there who talk about putting employees first because their employees then take good care of customers. But usually this is nothing more than talk while their behavior demonstrates something very different.

But for Wegmans, investing in their people is actually a cornerstone of their strategy and pays off in loyalty from employees and in turn, loyalty from customers.

In the same Forbes article, you can see just some of the tangible ways that they invest in people including structured development programs and scholarships that help people go from a part-time cashier in high school to a senior manager with college paid for along the way by Wegmans.

Again, it’s easy to see how other retailers will envy the success of Wegmans. But most will never be able to replicate it, because they just aren’t willing to share as much value with their employees.

It’s not a zero-sum game

If there is one thing to learn from Supreme and from Wegmans it’s that running a business is not a zero-sum game.

If your prices are low, you are giving value to your customers that will pay you back in other ways.

And if you are paying your employees above market rates they will pay you back with loyalty and great service.

Often when I’m looking at pricing with the startups that I mentor, we will do lots of analysis and try to optimize the best that we can.

This is still a worthwhile exercise, but always keep this in mind: Leaving some value on the table can be a good thing.

Bikes of New York,"The Data

Now that I’ve shared some of my pain with you, I should also share some of my results.

As previously mentioned, from January 2018 to February 2019 there were 19,459,370 trips registered. After some cleaning, slicing, and wrangling, my final working data set was reduced to 17,437,855 trips. These are trips by subscribers only, as I decided to drop casual riders and one-day customers.

Total annual membership of Citi Bike now stands at 150,929 subscribers — as per to Citi Bike’s monthly report. Let’s take a look at who they are.

Who is riding Citi Bike?

There isn’t much information available on each individual subscriber, but from the data, we were able to get age and gender based on aggregate ridership. These aggregations didn’t give the exact number of subscribers rather, the underlying distribution of the sample.

This was a great learning opportunity to make some interactive plots using Plotly. I found that it can be a little cumbersome at first, understanding the figure hierarchy. Plotly’s graphs are stunning because even though it was built using Python and the Django framework, on the front end it uses JavaScript and the Dr.js library — so after all, I did get to use D3.js a little.

The top birth year categories for subscribers are from 1987 to 1991. Let me make the disclaimer again, Citi Bike has 150, 929 subscribers today, in order to get the distribution of those subscribers I used aggregate functions on the ridership data, as you’ll see in the code snippets below.

Genderwise, the majority of the riders were male.

How long are they riding?

The average trip duration is 13 minutes, meaning that Subscribers are not riding long distances — remember, I dropped casual riders and one-time customers.

We can also take a look at the average trip number of trips per day of the week, and as expected, the numbers were slightly higher during weekdays than during the weekend. Showing the difference between weekend rides and weekday commutes.

Finally, I was interested in the relationship between the length of the ride and the day of the year.

This plot gives a complete self-explanatory picture of the fluctuation in the demand for Citi Bikes throughout the year, the demand being higher in the April-October interval when the weather is warmer. This got me curious about the relationship between the weather and the number of trips in a day, so I created a new Pandas DataFrame with the weather summary for each of the days in my original DataFrame using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

I then ran a Multiple Regression algorithm using the Scikit Learn library.

Multiple Regression using Scikit Learn

As it turns out, 62% of the variance in the number of trips per day can be explained by the weather.

Where are they going?

Some Citi Bike docking stations were certainly more popular than others. To map the most popular ones, both by start and end of the bike ride, I used the Folium library.

But before I could actually make an interactive map, I ran a SQL to get the top Citi Bike dock stations by rides volume. I tried mapping all of them the first time but, eventually, the program crashed. So I decided to settle for 100.

The top 5 stations by volume of riders are:

Pershing Square North with 1,576,381 trips

W 21 St & 6 Ave with 1,148,192 trips

E 17 St & Broadway with 1,121,953 trips

Broadway & E 22 St with 109,7314 trips

Broadway & E 14 St 96,901 trips

To put them in context, these are dock stations near Grand Central Station, Madison Square Park, Union Square Park, and Flatiron Building.

What about Bike 30657?

Finally, I would like to honor the bike with the most trips this last year, Bike 30657 — you’re now wondering if you’ve ever ridden it, aren’t you?.

With 2776 rides, and a total of 36,448 minutes of traveling this bike probably knows New York City better than I do. And so, as a parting gift, I’ll leave you with Bike 30657 so you can see it in action.",https://towardsdatascience.com/bikes-of-new-york-6e0bbe5507f8,Florencia Leoni,2019-04-20 00:21:12.789000+00:00,"Python,Exploratory Data Analysis,Plotly,Linear Regression,Data Visualization"
What’s In a Name?,"What’s In a Name?

Our President and Chief Experience Officer, Shane B. Santiago, shares how Bravely got its name.

For those of you with kids, you know how meaningful a name can be. It’s not simply a label; it’s an identity… a way you can create unique meaning for someone’s own personality, culture and sense of place in the world.

That may not fit on a business card.

Naming a company is no different. In this Golden Age of Entrepreneurialism, where startups abound—and new, unique names are so scarce that words are literally invented for the sake of disruption—it presents a daunting challenge.

So as we formed our collective of creatives and began ideating on a name, we started with what we felt was most important to convey when we stepped out into the world:

Purpose.

Meaning.

Value.

Easy enough, right?

Being an agency guy for nearly two decades, the easy solution was to slap our names on the door and call it a day. After all, it’s common practice in the ad world, and what’s more meaningful to an agency than the people who founded it?

That’s where we wanted to be different.

How can our name provide deeper insight into who we really are, and what value we believe we can share? We found the answer in our brand archetype.

We’re explorers.

Psychologist Carl Jung created archetypes as a construct to identify the primal and instinctive stories we all share through a collective unconscious and connect us as humans.

Of the 12 classic archetypes, it was easy for us to lay claim to The Explorer. We started this consultancy to stray from the herd. We wanted to find adventure, and to take risks. Discovery is paramount. Freedom is our promise. This couldn’t parallel our journey more accurately.

Levi’s gets us.

In an industry where “there are no new ideas,” copycat creative platforms often seek to build on already-existing successes rather than truly doing something different. It’s like pitching a movie; How often have you heard big ideas pitched that sounded like “It’s like Geico-meets-Snickers-but-on-Snapchat?”

I suppose there’s nothing wrong with that, if it works. But for us, our vision is to create value in doing the opposite. Testing and learning what’s successful by finding new insights.

But that’s scary.

Following trails blazed by successful ideas and insight isn’t a bad strategy. And we won’t completely abandon it. What we don’t want to do is become a slave to it. We can’t innovate by conforming. But when brands and clients have millions of dollars on the line, how can we convince them to take risks?

By having courage.

Is this how a big idea should be presented?

We hope to partner with clients to be their stewards of courage. Our approach relies heavily on collaboration. We eschew the traditional creative process in which we ruminate on a brief, disappear for a few weeks, then have a “Big Reveal™®©,” in a pageant often worthy of Vanna White flourishes. Ironically, I find this often more risky in that, for decades, this process is essentially a gamble that has our adrenaline pumping in hopes that the client simply “gets” our vision.

This is where we think we hit on something. By partnering with our clients throughout the process, with more frequent conversations and insight into the creative process, we’re essentially walking alongside them through the uncharted territory together. We’re like sherpas, guiding them through the adventure of discovery and innovation. Together. Not as agency-and-client.

As partners.

That settles it.

This was a profound moment in our process. We knew we wanted our clients to allow us to take risks and try new things. That’s table stakes today for innovation. But we want to be courageous with them. As a trusted partner where dialogue creates ownership and accountability on both sides, we think magic can happen. With less risk in the process itself, it allows us to take more risks creatively. Neat, right?

That was it. We decided to name ourselves not after who we are, or even what we do. Rather, we focused on how we do things. We empower our clients to have courage.

Our brand identity is a commitment to that process and we wanted our name to clearly and succinctly deliver on that promise.

As a result, we can confidently say, that the way we do anything — whether it’s creating a story, crafting an experience, building a product or developing a brand—is to do it Bravely.",https://medium.com/bravelycreated/whats-in-a-name-96699ffe950d,,2017-09-01 14:46:25.509000+00:00,"Marketing,Innovation,Creativity,Digital Marketing,Startup"
The Core Lesson of the COVID-19 Heart Debate,"From a virus’s point of view, the heart is both an easy target and a terrible one. It is easy to reach and invade because it collects blood from all over the body and, unlike the brain, has no protective barrier. But infecting the heart also risks killing the host without triggering symptoms that would allow a virus to easily spread — coughing, sneezing, diarrhea, or vomiting. For that reason, viruses that affect only the heart “do not exist,” says Efraín Rivera-Serrano, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

But viruses can incidentally affect the heart. They do so often enough that in the Western world, they are the most common cause of myocarditis. At least 20 known viruses can trigger this condition, including those that cause influenza, Zika, dengue, and measles.

The list also includes the original SARS virus: One Toronto-based study found its genetic material in seven of 20 autopsied hearts. These hearts also had myocarditis. By contrast, autopsied hearts with traces of the new coronavirus typically don’t (with some exceptions). The virus was there, but whether it was actually doing anything is unclear.

But a virus doesn’t need to be in the heart to wreak havoc. It can cause indirect damage by attacking the lungs and starving the heart of oxygen, or by triggering an inflammatory immune response that affects the entire body. Even viruses that primarily affect the gut (like enteroviruses) or the respiratory system (like adenoviruses) can cause myocarditis in this way, when molecules produced at the site of infection travel through the bloodstream and inflame the heart. Coxsackie B, for example, is the most widely studied cause of viral myocarditis, but is primarily a gut virus that spreads through fecal contamination; it can infect the heart, but it does much of its damage via the immune system.

“To say a virus is cardiac or vascular or respiratory simplifies things too much,” says Paul Checchia, a cardiologist at Texas Children’s Hospital. “Anytime a pathogen invades the body, the whole body reacts.” SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. The immune system’s response to this coronavirus can be slow to kick off, but then prolonged and severe. These immune overreactions are similar in kind to those triggered by other respiratory viruses, like influenza, but greater in degree. The heart could potentially be caught in this stronger crossfire.

But how often does that happen? In the early months of the pandemic, it seemed clear that the risk of heart injuries was “directly proportional to the severity of the illness,” says Neel Chokshi, a sports cardiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. But in July, a team led by Valentina Puntmann at University Hospital Frankfurt, in Germany, complicated that picture. The researchers showed that 78 percent of people who had recovered from COVID-19 (including many who had never been hospitalized) still had some kind of heart abnormality that was detectable on MRI scans two months later. About 60 percent still had signs of myocarditis.

The study was explosive. It spawned a wave of articles and papers about the possibility that COVID-19 could inflict stealthy and prolonged harm upon the hearts of people who aren’t outwardly sick, and reportedly influenced decisions about whether college athletes should be allowed to play. These intense discussions sparked intense criticism. Other scientists slammed the study for several errors, including data that were missing, reported incorrectly, or analyzed with the wrong statistical tests. The Frankfurt team corrected its paper, and says the main conclusions still stand.

“I think the data are good,” says Tiffany Chen of Penn Medicine, who specializes in cardiac imaging and was not involved in the study. “These were relatively healthy, mild cases of COVID-19, and they had a lot of abnormalities. It’s unsettling.” But the clinical implications of these findings — what they mean for COVID-19 patients whose symptoms have abated, but whose MRI scans are abnormal — aren’t yet understood, she says.

Viral myocarditis isn’t always a problem. It’s entirely possible that you have had the condition at some point in your life without ever realizing it. Some people recover but have persistent scarring that weakens their heart and increases the risk of problems years down the line. And in a third group, the inflammation rapidly worsens, leading to faulty heartbeats, heart failure, or even death.

The latter two outcomes are rare, but “it’s really hard to give accurate percentages,” says Chokshi. Doctors typically see cases of viral myocarditis only when they fall into the third group, and severe symptoms warrant MRIs and other diagnostic tests. “We don’t do MRIs on everyone who has the flu, so we don’t know how many have inflammation or what their long-term outcomes are,” says Martha Gulati, the cardiology chief at the University of Arizona. For example, in two small pilot studies, Checchia found signs of heart damage in 40 and 55 percent of children who were hospitalized with RSV — a common respiratory virus. “On discharge, they seemed perfectly fine,” he says. “But we couldn’t get funding to look at them months or years down the line.”

Without that information, it’s hard to know what to make of the Frankfurt COVID-19 study or others like it. Yes, some patients have myocarditis — but what does that mean? How do the numbers compare to other respiratory viruses? Will COVID-19 patients with myocarditis recover fully, or will some have long-term problems? Is this virus doing something strange, or are researchers just studying it more intensely than other viral infections? For now, it’s difficult to say.

The worry is that COVID-19 is doing whatever it’s doing at scale. The original SARS epidemic of 2003 infected only 8,000 people, killed slightly fewer than 800, and was over in three months; its impact on the heart was “lost in the historical bin of the scientific literature,” says Checchia. SARS-CoV-2, by contrast, has infected at least 31 million people and killed at least 960,000. Its effects are thousands of times more obvious than its predecessor’s. Even if it’s no worse than any other viral illness, its sheer scope means that a tiny risk of severe long-term problems would still translate to a lot of failing hearts.

Reassuringly, “there hasn’t been an obvious influx of patients being admitted to the hospital with unexplained myocarditis, despite the huge numbers who have had COVID-19,” says Venkatesh Murthy, a cardiologist at the University of Michigan. “I don’t find it convincing that there is a major amount of serious clinically relevant myocarditis in people who are feeling well.”

Still, he and others say that long-term studies are important. “We’re still early,” says Chen. “I don’t think there’s a defined time point when we’d expect to see heart failure, so we have to follow these patients for months or years down the road.”

That can be unnerving for people who are currently sick. Long-haulers, who are struggling with months of debilitating COVID-19 symptoms, are “responding to the media’s interpretation of these studies and, to put it bluntly, are rightfully freaking out,” said Kontorovich, who is part of a team that provides care for long-haulers. But for now, she sees the myocarditis issue and the long-hauler phenomenon as separate matters.

Some long-haulers have been diagnosed with dysautonomia — a group of disorders that disrupt involuntary bodily functions, including heartbeats (which can become inexplicably fast) and blood pressure (which can suddenly crash). But people who have lingering heart problems after viral myocarditis don’t usually experience the chronic symptoms that long-haulers do, and they typically have measurable changes to their hearts that long-haulers don’t. “There may be a connection, but it hasn’t been proved,” Kontorovich said.

College athletes are also facing immediate decisions. In just the past two months, the 27-year-old basketball player Michael Ojo died from a heart attack during a practice, while the 20-year-old football player Jamain Stephens Jr. died from a blood clot in his heart. Both had previously contracted COVID-19.

In a recent study, a research team at the Ohio State University scanned the hearts of 26 college athletes who tested positive for COVID-19 and had mild or absent symptoms. Four of them — 15 percent — had signs of myocarditis. But the Ohio study didn’t examine a control group of similar athletes who didn’t have COVID-19, and even healthy athletes experience changes in their heart as they train, including features that are “similar to what you might see with infections or scarring,” says Gulati, the cardiologist at the University of Arizona.

If athletes come down with clinical myocarditis — that is, with obvious signs of heart problems — they’re taken out of play for at least three months to let the infection run its course and to give the heart a chance to bounce back. The question now is: What to do about the people who have subclinical myocarditis after COVID-19, which presents with no symptoms and can be seen only on a medical scanner? Chokshi, the sports cardiologist, says the risk that these abnormalities will lead to heart failure “is very, very low,” but “the outcome is catastrophic.” The American College of Cardiology published guidance advising that all athletes who test positive for COVID-19 rest for at least two weeks, even if they show no symptoms.

Setting myocarditis aside, it still makes sense to stop players from spreading the virus to one another, especially when so many colleges are facing large outbreaks. “There are plenty of reasons to not play football independent of this issue,” Murthy says. “We already have plenty of evidence to take COVID-19 seriously.”",https://medium.com/the-atlantic/the-core-lesson-of-the-covid-19-heart-debate-849ae7020b0f,Ed Yong,2020-09-22 23:50:20.275000+00:00,"Health,Science,Long Covid,Coronavirus,Covid 19"
Why You Need to Write More Than One Headline,"Why You Need to Write More Than One Headline

Hone your skill for writing brilliant headlines quickly

Illustration by Cynthia Marinakos.

How many headlines do you write for one article?

I used to write one in a few seconds, impatient to publish after spending hours, days, sometimes weeks, to finish a draft. I treated headlines more like an insignificant crowd extra, rather than the star of the show.

That was a stupid thing to do. I now realize I wrote mediocre headlines most of the time.

I was being selfish and impatient. You see, when you write vague or clever headlines that don’t serve your reader — they’ll ignore you.

The most important person in all our worlds — is ourselves. That is true for us. And for our reader.

They want something. They’ve got to figure out how to earn more money. How to get more sh*t done. How to start a side hustle because they hate their job. They want to be more creative. To figure out how to get fitter, redecorate their homes, get their kids off sugar.

Your reader — your customer — is here because they have a challenge and they want the solution so they can have an easier, happier, less stressful life.

Your headline needs to tell them it’s worth them reading the next line. And the next. And the next.

Headlines are essential in every writer’s toolbox. In every marketer’s toolbox. Like any tool, it can’t be used well unless you’ve learned how to use it. To use it skillfully, you’ve got to put in a consistent and focused effort. You’ve got to write more than one headline.

Adding Timed Comments and Waveforms to Spotify,"Generating waveforms from Spotify tracks is the first problem I tackled when putting together this prototype. I ended up using the Spotify Platform’s Audio Analysis endpoint to get the loudness levels of the track and then simplify that data into an array of values I could use to dynamically generate the waveform using canvas. Rather than generate this data every time a user visits the app, this prototype caches the waveform data for each visited track once for future visits.

I have also provided a CodePen on how the final waveform was generated.

Spotify Player

Typically when I build custom Spotify player interfaces, I use their Web Playback SDK because it allows you to simply stream full tracks to premium Spotify users who authenticate with your app. The big issue with this SDK is that it doesn’t work on mobile devices currently. In an attempt to make this solution more accessible, I turned to the Spotify Connect Web API. Instead of being able to stream full tracks through your web app like the Web Playback SDK, the Connect Web API allows you to remotely control an open piece of Spotify software on one of your user’s devices. This API can be pretty temperamental but when it works, it’s a decent solution.

Spotify Comments

The comments solution I put together for this web app draws from the Spotify powered chat solution I developed for the Future Islands project. This app also uses Spotify’s Implicit Grant Flow to authenticate users via a popup. Users must also be authenticated in this way to use the Connect Web API.

Once authenticated, users may tap into the text input to begin writing a message. When the input is focused, they may use an avatar slider on the waveform to position their comment on the timeline. Posted comments are sent to an awaiting Serverless endpoint and added to a DynamoDB. These comments are stored with the timestamp of their position on the timeline so they may be visually placed on the waveform again.

What’s Next?

For this particular prototype, I had the thought of making the comments come through in real time like the Future Island’s chat but that is likely something I’ll investigate later. The point of this experiment was to further explore what social features built off the Spotify Platform could look like. Through experiments such as this and in my client work, I hope to continue to investigate this topic. I hope the information shared proves useful to you as well and I’d love to hear what you think and more importantly, what you build.

Hydroxychloroquine Probably Doesn’t Work For COVID-19,"There are some pieces that you never really expect to write. Whether it’s geophagy, or people literally eating dirt, drinking blood to prevent aging, or just the ongoing saga about whether meat is deadly or perfectly curative for health, there are a lot of topics that I’ve covered over the years that are, well, a bit strange.

And yet, in some ways this feels like the strangest. If you’d told me in 2019 that we’d be debating the benefits of an anti-malarial medication for pandemic disease despite a mountain of evidence that it didn’t work, I’d probably have giggled nervously and walked away.

Stock photo search results for “nervous” are…odd, to say the least. Source: Pexels

Which brings us to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). One of the strangest stories that I have ever written.

It probably doesn’t work for coronavirus. We knew that some time ago. But somehow, it’s still a debate to be had.

The Evidence

Back in the heady days of early 2020, before we had all locked down and politicized medications, HCQ was just another drug that people thought might be useful for COVID-19. There were dozens, even hundreds, of proposed treatments, so one more drug didn’t seem like a big deal — we could test it, see if it worked, and then use or discard it just like all the others.

Pictured: Not special. Drugs usually aren’t. Source: Pexels

And we did do those tests. Massive, well-conducted studies, with appropriate scientific controls that looked at the question of whether HCQ helped with coronavirus. The results are in, so what did they find?

Hydroxychloroquine probably doesn’t work for coronavirus. It doesn’t help people who have severe illness. It doesn’t prevent illness in high-risk groups. There’s no evidence it benefits people with mild disease either, even in combination with azithromycin. There’s still a bit of a question mark over whether HCQ might reduce the risk of getting the disease for people who are low-risk, but the initial results are not looking good.

Now, you can take those results as you like, but it’s worth noting that these are really quite impressive trials. Running a properly controlled randomized study of over a thousand people in less than six months is an immensely impressive work, and the findings are both stark and uncompromising: HCQ probably doesn’t benefit COVID-19, and may be harmful.

As certain right-wing pundits like to say, facts don’t care about your feelings.

Political Problems

Thing is, the facts aren’t going to stop this debate. Our well-developed hierarchy of evidence, going from expert opinion (mostly useless) to controlled, randomized research (very useful), means very little in the face of the HCQ discussion.

Because, you see, it’s not really about the science.

Pictured: Science, probably Source: Pexels

If it was about the science, we’d have discarded HCQ months ago along with the other medications that have failed to show a benefit (anyone remember ritonavir?). Instead, we have people dividing their opinions over political lines — if you are right-wing, in certain places in the world, you support HCQ.

This is, to say the least, a very unusual state of affairs. It’s rare that you have a tug-of-war between political parties about whether a drug works.

The problem, to a great degree, appears to come back to whether government interventions are necessary to combat COVID-19. People who are against lockdowns and similar interventions point to HCQ and say “look, no need for the government to do anything, we have this miracle cure right here!”. The fact that there are no miracle cures, and that HCQ has very little good evidence recommending it, could never get in the way of what is essentially an ideological argument.

Which is why, in the comments, you’d expect to see a bunch of people calling me left-wing, a socialist, demon spawn etc. Not because I’m wrong, but because the drug has taken on a life outside of the questions about whether it works or not. People will probably accuse me of being in the pockets of pharmaceutical companies because HCQ is cheap (and thus I MUST be getting paid to write this), ignoring the fact that I happily accept the similarly good evidence showing that dexamethasone can prevent death in severe cases of COVID-19 and it’s cheap as chips.

Honestly, it’s all a bit tiresome.

So, no, hydroxychloroquine probably doesn’t work for COVID-19. Of course, it’s possible that new evidence will come to light disproving the studies done so far, but at this point it really is quite unlikely.

We can hope that the debate will finally be laid to rest, but since it’s no longer about facts it’s probably never going to happen.

How Creative Incubation Helps Your Brain Solve Challenging Problems,"Have you ever worked on a puzzle or attempted to solve a problem to the point of frustration, only to step away for a while, take a break, and have the solution seemingly “pop up” out of nowhere?

Chances are, you’ve probably had this experience at least once in life, even if it was only in regards to something trivial — such as a video game task or a minor problem at the home or office.

The world has taken to calling such moments “Aha!” moments, and recent research suggests that rather than being a phenomenon exclusive to “creative geniuses,” anyone can take steps to improve the likelihood that they will have these experiences.

For the purposes of this piece, I’m interested in elaborating upon the process of “creative incubation,” which is when we give our brain time to process what it has learned — away from the hard work we put in to actually “feed” it information.

“Aha!” moments usually arise after a period of incubation, when our brain has been given sufficient idle time to work on a problem below the surface of conscious attention, where subconscious neural processes dominate.

The tendency for our brains to discover solutions when our conscious awareness is diverted from the problem we’re trying to solve has long confounded researchers and laypersons alike.

How could it be that we solve a puzzle without “trying” to solve it?

Surely, the more rational side of ourselves would posit that we need to work out each and every step of a solution linearly (as we would a math problem) until we arrive at the correct solution.

Yet that’s not always what happens — even in the logical domain of math.

Sometimes, a difficult problem confounds even the most skilled mathematician, in which case a solution pops into her head only after she takes some time away from the whiteboard.

Because of this, our culture has tended to shroud its geniuses under a cloak of mystery. Unfortunately, this had led many to believe that the same processes that happen in their brains can’t happen in their own.

Because of its mysterious quality, incubation has often been thought the most creative part of the entire process. The conscious sequences can be analyzed, to a certain extent, by the rules of logic and rationality. But what happens in the “dark” spaces defies ordinary analysis and evokes the original mystery shrouding the work of genius: One feels almost the need to turn to mysticism, to invoke the voice of the Muse as an explanation. — Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

Modern research, however, is demystifying this process — if only a little bit.

We now know that both the more conscious, linear approach toward solving problems and the more nonlinear, subconscious element is necessary when it comes to working through difficult problems.

Creative incubation is a factor in the latter element — the subconscious.

But it’s necessary for me to stop right here and make one, essential clarification: there are no short-cuts or easy methods of becoming a more creative individual or a better problem solver.

The brain is a miraculous organ, one that modern science has still barely scratched the surface of when it comes to understanding its connection-making abilities.

Even so, the only way to enhance our creativity and tackle difficult problems is through rigorous practice — we cannot rely on idle time or the brain’s subconscious processes alone.

In other words, while it is true that our brains have an undiscovered potential, without our conscious effort to unlock that potential, we will remain stagnant.

It might be accurate to say that the “trying” is as important as the “not trying.”

The mathematician discovers the solution to a challenging problem only after having made the attempt to solve it at the whiteboard — and after the hours and even years of work required to learn the language of mathematics.

Likewise, it is difficult to imagine anyone creating their own song using a guitar without first putting in the necessary hours it takes to master the motions needed to play the notes on the instrument with grace and precision.

In the same way, the brain — for as marvelous as it is — only gives in proportion to what it is given, by way of the time we set aside for learning new knowledge and practicing its practical applications.

In other words, for creative incubation to take place, we need to supply our brain with a whole lot of dots that it can form connections between.

Otherwise, idle time is just idle time — there isn’t necessarily anything productive to be gained from it.

That being said, anyone interested in practicing self-improvement, learning a new skill, or becoming a better problem-solver at home or in the workplace should be encouraged by the insights offered by recent research into the nature of creativity and how the brain produces it.

It’s no longer necessary to sell ourselves short under the belief that we simply aren’t “intelligent” enough to discover the limits of our own creative potential.

We may or may not make a huge impact on the world by becoming creative, but we can certainly make a huge impact on our own lives.

So, how can we ensure that we strike the right balance between conscious effort and subconscious idle time?

Well, it helps to think about the importance of rest, relaxation, and taking breaks, even as one strives to maximize their productivity.

In our culture, we have tended to value the idea of the workaholic — someone who prizes work above all else and looks down on leisure time.

In the long run, however, denying ourselves leisure time actually hampers our creativity and problem-solving abilities.

You’ll know this is true if you think back to a time you tried for hours on end to solve a difficult problem — such as fixing a household appliance, car, or something of that nature — to the point where your brain felt like mush.

I’ve experienced that several times over the course of my life in relation to troubleshooting computer issues or school-related problems.

At some point, we actually become less productive and more likely to make mistakes or go around in circles without ever making any progress on the task at hand.

It’s when we feel to begin that way that it’s time to take a break.

Simply being aware of the importance of rest and relaxation — as well as society’s imbalanced work culture — is enough to start getting ourselves back in touch with our more creative sides by allowing our brain the time it needs to process information and events.

Although it sounds like something a workaholic would do, it can be helpful to think of rest time as being worthy of its own spot on our schedules.

Setting aside a few hours a week to simply do nothing, or enjoy some passive entertainment — such as Netflix or scrolling through social media — isn’t a bad thing provided said time is used intelligently to make our self-improvement practice more holistic.

Better yet, we could take breaks by doing activities that are less passive yet still considered “leisurely” — such as playing a musical instrument.

As long as we enjoy the activity such that it feels like a break from what we consider to be “work,” then it can be considered idle time.

Then who knows?

Maybe you’ll start having more “Aha!” moments yourself!

Just remember to always have healthy expectations.

As Mihaly points out, the more significant the problem we are trying the solve, the more conscious work we will need to put in to give our brain enough material with which to produce a solution.

How long a period of incubation is needed varies depending on the nature of the problem. It may range from a few hours to several weeks and even longer. — Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

Fixing a minor computer glitch is one thing, figuring out a coherent, testable theory of quantum gravity is quite another.

The former might require that we only take a fifteen-minute break to rest up before going back at it, whereas the latter might take a person’s entire lifetime in conjunction with the lifetimes of several other people who have worked on the same problem.

One thing is clear, however.

In order to “exercise” our creativity, we need to make sure that our conscious efforts to solve problems and produce novel ideas are balanced with ample leisure time in which our brain’s subconscious neural activities can work on the same problem “beneath the surface” so to speak.

So when thinking about our self-improvement/productivity journeys, we need to value both dedicated learning and practice, as well as the leisure time our brain needs to form new connections.

If you ask me, that’s the best of both worlds!

I think few people want all of their time to feel “leisurely.” On the flip side, most people don’t want their entire lives to feel like “work.”

Luckily for us, creativity dwells between these seemingly opposed poles.

Could Cloud Computing Be the Missing Piece of the Puzzle That Your Business Needs?,"Hybrid Cloud Strategy brings the best of both worlds into the realm of cloud computing. Here, you can use both public and private clouds in your infrastructure. While developing the services for this kind of architecture, one thing to keep in mind is their interoperability. That means services on the public cloud should seamlessly work with the services that reside on the private cloud and vice versa.

Once the interoperability of services is taken care of, it opens the door to countless benefits that you can get from this type of hybrid implementation. You can utilize the scalability and portability of the public cloud infrastructure, while at the same time, maintaining the security of the sensitive data of the company, firewalled against in your private cloud on-premise.

Choosing the right combination of clouds

The selection of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider is dependent on your usage type. There are multiple numbers of criteria that one may need to look at before choosing an ideal provider. Some of which are -

Robustness of the platform Security on the network Whether they are following best practices or not Their SLA Flexibility for the developers How easily the integration can be done Interoperability with the private or other cloud platforms Usability Functionality

The order of these criteria entirely depends on your use case. To rearrange this list according to your priority.

“Moving Computation is Cheaper than moving data”

Once you are using the cloud, you will be storing a huge amount of data online. According to the principle of “code moving to data”, if your code is smaller (which typically is) as compared to the data you have, It is wise to move your code to the cloud rather than moving your data to the code.

By moving code to the cloud, every node will be able to replicate it for its own execution independent of others. Hence it will decrease any latency significantly because there is no need to send code on demand.

Observability, Monitoring, and Analytics

When you are running an IT business as complex as a nation, you need an eagle’s eye to capture every detail of what’s happening within your workflow. And this comes with the integration of the right tools into your infrastructure. Tools that can help you track a system’s health in microseconds, so whenever any catastrophe happens, you know where to look.

In any case, as I said prior, we are managing the “complex” frameworks here. That implies we will manage the BigData. Each endeavor has its own inclinations and nobody needs to be controlled by the pre-planned UI given by a product.

Henceforth, you should search for stages that can furnish you with an adaptable lightweight UI where the portrayal of factual or authentic information is in your own hands. Tools that let you structure incredible dashboards for continuous synopsis and summarizations.

Along with all this, drill-down capabilities for exploring multi-dimensional data is crucial in any reporting tool for gaining more helpful insights. This feature not only reduces the load from the server by not sending all of the data at once but also helps us see the bigger picture.",https://medium.com/swlh/could-cloud-computing-be-the-missing-piece-of-the-puzzle-that-your-business-needs-c3a0029c9dad,Nishu Jain,2020-12-21 11:50:15.904000+00:00,"Business,Technology,Cloud Computing,Startup,Software Engineering"
It’s Time for a ‘Device Divorce’,"But, even though we don’t evenly distribute all of our activities amongst all our devices, we still do a little of everything on all our devices. Maybe we do most of our social media on our phone, but we also do a lot of social media on our laptop. Maybe we do most of our email on our computer, but we also do email on our tablet.

The problem with this is, it exposes us to path dependency, gone rogue. If we take a wrong turn, we end up on the wrong road. Once we’re on the wrong road, it takes that much longer to get where we’re trying to go.

Think of it this way: You can do a lot of things with a toothbrush. You can scrub your teeth with a toothbrush. You can also scrub your toilet with a toothbrush. But would you scrub your teeth and your toilet with the same brush? No!

So why use the same device to do two things that are completely at odds with one another? Why surf the web with the same device you use to write? Why chat with your friends on the same device you use to meditate?

You need to split up. You need a Device Divorce. You need to make it easy to get to the places you want to go, and hard take a wrong turn to the places you don’t want to go.

A simple exercise to begin your Device Divorce

To begin a Device Divorce, try this exercise: Draw three columns on a piece of paper. At the top of each of the respective three columns, write laptop, tablet, and smartphone. Now, in the respective column, write down the activities that you primarily do on each of these devices.

Do you see any contradictions? If you go down one path to do one of these things, will that take you farther and farther from another path to do another thing?

Will it break your focus? Will it dampen your momentum? Will it alter your mental state to go down Instagram Alley instead of Scrivener Circle?

If so, you aren’t using your devices, your devices are using you.

Next, make a decision. Decide what activities you will do on each of the three devices. But, just as important, decide which activities you will not do on each of these three devices.

My personal device arsenal

Me, I do most of my writing on my iPad, with an external keyboard. I do not do email on my iPad. I do not do messaging on my iPad.

I try to do as much email as I can on my iPhone. But, I don’t have Twitter or Facebook installed on my iPhone. I’d be taking wrong turns, left and right.

My laptop, I simply try to limit its usage as much as possible. My laptop is a “slippy” tool. Too many side roads and detours.

Your Device Divorce doesn’t have to stop at your primary electronic devices. According to a poll I did on Twitter, three out of four of you already have an extra tablet or smartphone just lying around.

These old devices often can’t run the latest software (thank you, planned obsolescence).

Can I Write One Good Sentence?,"Can I Write One Good Sentence?

The brilliant advice F. Scott Fitzgerald never actually gave

Photo by Peter Pryharski on Unsplash

In the early 20th century, the most important man in the world of American literature wasn’t an author. His name was Maxwell Perkins.

Perkins was an editor at Scribner, a publishing house in New York City. In 1919, he signed a young, unknown author, making a big bet on aspiring talent against the will of his seniors at the company. The author he signed was F. Scott Fitzgerald, who would go on to write and publish The Great Gatsby in cooperation with Perkins.

One year after Gatsby, which wouldn’t sell well for the next 15 years, Perkins met and signed another author of questionable status: Ernest Hemingway. After the two books they worked on together — The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms — found commercial successes, Perkins became the most sought after editor in the country.

The 2016 movie Genius tells the story of Perkins and another prodigious discovery of his: Thomas Wolfe. Wolfe was the son Perkins, who had five daughters, always longed for. He was poetic, passionate, and notoriously incapable of cutting a single word from his flowery prose. In other words, he was a writer through and through.

As an editor, one of Perkins’ main responsibilities was to cut the inessential. He did so for all of his writers but for none more than Wolfe. His first novel, Look Homeward, Angel, went from 294,000 words to 234,000 under Perkins’ guidance — and it sold like hotcakes. Taking the feedback of “write more” a bit too literally, Wolfe turned around and produced another manuscript: The 5,000-page draft for Of Time and the River, which him and Perkins fought over for two years before it finally saw the light of day.

Then, despite the book’s success, a trauma befell Wolfe that catches every writer at some point: Wolfe got writer’s block. For months, he was unable to put pen to paper. Eventually, he took a long, solo trip all the way to California, where, among other things, he visited Fitzgerald. I doubt the scene played out as depicted in the movie, but the advice he gave Wolfe — no doubt inspired by Perkins’ dedication as an editor — is priceless nonetheless:

Thomas Wolfe: “More and more I trouble myself with that, the legacy. Will anyone care about Thomas Wolfe in 100 years? 10 years?” F. Scott Fitzgerald: “When I was young, I asked myself that question everyday. Now, I ask myself, ‘Can I write one good sentence?’”

For any writer, there are more ifs and thens and whats and whens to obsess over than hours in the day. What if no one cares about my idea? Will the book sell once it’s out? When can I make a living from my craft? What does it all amount to? Will I leave behind a legacy? There is no quicker way to obliterate your ability to chain words together than to hop on this never-ending merry-go-round of hypotheticals.

Instead, as Perkins drilled into his authors when fighting with them over every word, as Fitzgerald finally realized after years of failure, dedicate your obsession to the micro. Forget the book, the chapter, even the page and the very next paragraph. Ask one question and one question alone. The only question that matters: Can I write one good sentence?

Even if the encounter was fictional, even if Fitzgerald never said these words, there’s a high chance he had internalized them regardless. How do I know? Well, the other grand disciple of Perkins, Hemingway, left us with the exact same advice. It’s a famous line that’s been quoted countless times: “Write the truest sentence that you know.”

What did this mean for Hemingway? He explains it to us in the paragraph the quote is from — the majority of which most quoters omit:

Sometimes when I was starting a new story and could not get it going, I would sit in front of the fire and squeeze the peel of the little oranges into the edge of the flame and watch the sputter of blue that they made. I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think, “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.” So finally I would write one true sentence, and then go on from there.

As Nick Wignall notes, it is the throwing-orange-peel-into-the-fire part that is most crucial to understanding the advice. “That was his one true sentence that lead to his now famous ‘Write one true sentence’ quote,” Wignall writes. It was the only thing he knew to be true at the time: When I have writer’s block, I toss fruit into a fire. So that’s where he began.

Your next, first, final sentence being true is all nice and well, but, going back to Fitzgerald’s version of the tip, we now must ask: Is it also a good sentence?

Undoubtedly, Hemingway’s messy eating habits meet those criteria. There’s color, there’s fruit, there’s fire. Fire is dangerous. Fruit is a symbol of life. The colors change, and so does the situation. Feeding orange peel to the flames is not an everyday occurrence. See how many more metaphors we already extracted from this one line? You can imagine the scene as funny — an enraged Hemingway hurling oranges into his fireplace — or deeply thoughtful — the mindless flick of a finger causes a blue spark and loud crackle as Hemingway turns back to his desk. That is one heck of a sentence. Did Hemingway know when he wrote it? Doubtful. But he trusted the truth, and he deliberated on it long enough to stick with his decision — and that made all the difference.

Unfortunately for Wolfe, he never got to practice the advice he received from Fitzgerald. Weeks after his visit, he died of tuberculosis at just 37 years old. He did, however, leave behind a legacy — and a letter to his former editor, Maxwell Perkins:

I shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.

Now that’s a good sentence. I think you should write one.",https://medium.com/better-marketing/can-i-write-one-good-sentence-87cec760bcb7,Niklas Göke,2020-04-09 11:51:00.906000+00:00,"Writing Tips,Writing,Creativity,Books,Art"
Decapitating Consciousness,"I believe I am as conscious as anyone. When I am awake and my eyes are open, I see a stable, colorful, and continuous world all around me, and that world doesn’t wobble when my eyes move. This fact alone suggests that I am experiencing consciousness, because what I am perceiving transcends the visual signals my retinas are receiving. Those signals are messy, in part because eyes move almost continuously and in part because the retina includes an area — the scotoma — that doesn’t react to light; it is a blind spot that is somehow getting filled in by my brain.

My other senses also help me perceive a rich and orderly world which is, I am fairly sure, being constructed by my brain — more evidence that I am “conscious.” I am also reasonably good — as good as one can be, anyway, which isn’t very good — at picturing things from my past: people I used to know, places I have visited, the room I slept in when I was four. I can also imagine things I have never seen, even things that could never exist: the Eiffel Tower upside-down, Donald Trump with three heads, a line of people a mile long waiting to take advantage of the free food offer at the Russian Tea Room in New York (now there is a fantasy).

I also talk to myself a great deal. And, yes, I also experience a wide range of feelings — as wide, I believe, as anyone feels. At the moment, I am mainly feeling nervous about all the criticism I will get from various “experts” about the content of the essay I am now writing.

So, do I qualify? Do I seem to you to be conscious, or at least to be a good liar who knows what to say to convince people I am conscious? Let’s assume the former, at least for the moment, so I can get on with things.

My world has always been full of mysteries, such as: What happens to the thousands of tons of rubber that wear off the tires of our cars and trucks every year? Why isn’t it piling up on the sides of our roads, blocking the views of our houses? And: If I hang upside down every day, will I get taller or at least stop shrinking as I get older?

For much of my adult life, I have also wondered about something that is supposed to be mysterious but that has never seemed so to me: Why, for centuries, have people considered consciousness to be something beyond human understanding? Now don’t get me wrong. By “people,” I don’t mean people in general. Most people don’t think much about consciousness, other than having some dim awareness of the fact that alcohol and drugs screw it up and, of course, that sleep or a good head bashing temporarily turn it off. And then there is death, of course.

No, by “people,” I mean a special class of people who are paid — at least a few of them are paid — to sit around and think about everything and then debate each other about their thoughts and then, in some cases, train other people to think about things exactly the same way they do. You know, academics.

For at least two millennia now, such people, and especially the philosophers among them, have insisted (a) that consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries in the world and (b) that they have solved or at least shed light on this mystery, each in his or her own special way. I could at this point try to impress you with what a dedicated scholar I am by summarizing and then criticizing the views of Aristotle and Augustine, Dennett and Descartes, Heidegger and Hume, Hegel and Nagel, Kant and Carnap, James and Jaynes, Plato and Penrose, Russell and Ryle, and on and on and on. The list of scholars who have weighed in on consciousness is so impressive and diverse that sometimes I think people write about consciousness just to get on a list with Plato and Aristotle on it. Perhaps that is why I am writing this article now!

Instead of slogging through the list, however, I will simply suggest you watch a popular 2014 TED talk by the Australian philosopher, David Chalmers — perhaps the leading consciousness expert in the world. In a mere 18 minutes, he will confirm three things for you: (a) that he believes consciousness is “the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe” (not just one of the most mysterious phenomena, and not just on planet Earth), (b) that “we are well on our way to a serious theory” of consciousness — a statement he has repeated in various forms for more than 20 years now, and, unfortunately, (c) that he actually has no idea what consciousness is or how it works. At least that is I how interpret the video; you make up your own mind.

Chalmers is a champion of the “panpsychism” view of consciousness, according to which consciousness is a property of everything in the universe — and since we are part of the universe — well, there you are. Got it? He also says consciousness is like “a movie playing in your head.” And then there is Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose’s neural theory of consciousness, according to which consciousness arises from the vibrations of millions of microtubules in the neurons of the brain. Philosopher Patricia Churchland has labeled this the “pixie dust” theory of consciousness, which I think sums up the flaws of the theory nicely. How does moving consciousness to small structures in brain cells shed any light on it?

Consciousness theorists routinely commit at least one of three analytical errors when formulating their theories — often, all three. The first is the reification error. That is when we start to treat some phenomenon as a thing, even though it is not. When Einstein and his contemporaries began speculating about the existence of subatomic particles, they were not committing this error; they believed these particles existed, and subsequent research confirmed their speculations in some respects. When we start to treat “consciousness” as a thing, however, we are reifying. Consciousness is not a thing, a place, or a world — more on this later.

The second error is autocentrism, which I define as excessive focusing on the experience of being “me.” Humans have routinely impeded the progress of science by putting some aspect of themselves into the center of things. In the 1600s, Galileo was punished by the Catholic Church for defending Copernicus’ assertion that the earth is not the center of the universe (“geocentrism”). “Eurocentrism,” which, among other things, means imposing European values on the rest of the world, has distorted thinking and theories in anthropology, sociology, literature, and other fields. Psychology, my own field, was troubled by another kind of centrism called “anthropomorphism” — the attributing of human characteristics to nonhumans. We just love focusing on ourselves, sometimes to our detriment.

The third error is an extreme form of autocentrism I call cognicentrism: focusing specifically on the importance of one’s own cognitive experiences, as if one’s thought processes had some special significance. Modern scientific psychology was launched in 1879 by a cognicentric German scientist named Wilhelm Wundt, who believed that a science of cognition was possible. Wundt, in turn, had been influenced by the work of another German scientist, Gustav Fechner, who had been searching since the mid1800s for laws of “psychophysics” — laws relating the mental world to the physical (Chalmers said he too was searching for “psychophysical laws” in an article he published in 1995).

Cognicentrism is the most pernicious of the three errors. Some academics are so fascinated by their own internal movie — it is in full color, after all, with 3-D and surround sound — they think it must be real, never considering a much simpler and more sensible possibility.

As an exercise, please set aside for the moment the questionable assertion that consciousness is a thing or a place or a world or a movie; in other words, resist the temptation to reify. Also, please consider the possibility that the fact that you seem to have a strong sense of being you is not actually a big deal — not big enough to build a science around, anyway. Finally, even though you seem to have a movie playing in your head, please entertain the idea that there really is no movie in your head (because there isn’t) and that your conscious experiences might not be as important as you think they are. In other words, as best you can, please set aside any autocentric or cognicentric inclinations you might have.

This brings me, finally, to what I am pretty sure consciousness actually is. Following the tradition of the many great sages who have gotten us so confused about consciousness, I will explain my perspective initially through an analogy — let’s call it The Hot Tub Harry Analogy.

Hot Tub Harry is sitting up to his neck in hot water. He can feel the heat, the flow of the water around him, the bubbles — even, let’s say, the texture of the water, which is a bit oily. To simplify matters, we shall plug his ears and nose and cover his eyes, so that most of the stimulation he is receiving is coming from receptor cells in his skin. He and the water form a kind of system, like a fetus does with a womb.

A few feet away from this hot-tub system (HTS) stands a scientist who is speculating about what it is like to experience life in the HTS. She is not having much luck, though, because she has never been in a hot tub and is not part of Harry’s HTS. She can see the system from afar, but she is not part of it. She can see vapor rising from the water, which suggests the water is hot, but she cannot feel the water. She can see bubbles and signs of currents, but she cannot feel them. Moreover, no matter how closely she examines the system from the outside, she cannot say anything about what it is like to be part of the system. Meanwhile, Harry has no trouble at all feeling exactly what it is like to be part of the system. There is, in general, an enormous difference between being an integral part of a system and being outside a system.

Our brains are not only part of our bodies, they are also wired directly to it, including to all of our sense organs. Light entering our eyes stimulates light-sensitive cells on our retinas, which in turn stimulate nerve cells that connect to our brain through a bundle of nerve fibers. A fraction of a second later, through a process that is not yet understood, neural processes allow us to see a stable and continuous version of the world around us. The visual part of what we call our “consciousness” is our experience of seeing that world. Our brain also manages to integrate much of the chaotic and noisy stimulation that surrounds us into coherent wholes; in fact, as the research of Gestalt psychologists demonstrated a century ago, our brain seems almost driven to create wholes from parts and order from chaos. We have two eyes, after all, sending two somewhat different stimulus patterns into our brain, which somehow manages to coordinate them.

This shouldn’t be too surprising. The scotoma is present in all vertebrates, and so are two eyes. Given the superb eye-limb coordination that is evident throughout the animal kingdom, it would appear that brains have evolved to stabilize images, fill in gaps, and organize and simplify stimuli. No matter what the species, the owners of brains that did not do such things would have quickly been culled from the gene pool. Imagine a saber-toothed tiger that had to prowl around its environment using the unsmoothed, rapidly shifting, incomplete, somewhat differing images being projected onto the retinas of its two eyes; even if, by some miracle, it managed to find its prey, the prey might have eaten it long before it managed to eat its prey.

The fact that we do not yet understand how the brain accomplishes these transformations is not important. Consciousness is the observational experience we have after these transformations have taken place.

So, getting back to Harry, he can, through receptor cells in his skin, feel properties of the water, and he can also observe himself feeling properties of the water. He is built not only to sense properties of the world around him (which are then smoothed by the brain in various ways), he is also built to observe some aspects of his own functioning. Remarkably, he can also visualize events from his past while sitting in the hot tub — even fantasize about things that have never occurred.

We experience different degrees of consciousness, of course. When Harry starts to get drowsy from the hot water, his consciousness fades, which is to say he observes less and less about the surrounding environment and about his own observational experience. He might also adapt to some aspects of his environment, which means, by definition, that his awareness of those aspects of his environment dims; over time, for example, he will probably get used to the temperature of the water. Harry also has some control over what properties of his environment and experience he pays attention to. When he pays close attention to what he is experiencing in the moment, we might say he is highly conscious of what is around him. If his thoughts drift to other matters, we might say he is only dimly conscious of what is around him.

No matter how you cut the cake, consciousness is simple observation — either of properties of the environment around us or of properties of our own experience, both past and present. Although it is true that Hot Tub Harry’s conscious experiences while he sits in the tub are not accessible to the observer outside the tub, they are by no means mysterious.

Perhaps you will object: Hold on! you say. The analogy is flawed! Harry is a person with sense organs and a brain! All you have done is push the problem of consciousness to another location, just as Hameroff and Penrose did when they attributed consciousness to the vibrations of microtubules.

But I wasn’t done yet! Let’s work on Harry a bit — nothing too drastic, just a minor surgical modification: Let’s get rid of his body, leaving his brain and skin receptors in the water. We shall also add nutrients to the water to keep his tissue healthy. Because Harry’s brain and skin receptors are alive in the HTS/nutrient bath, he is presumably still conscious of the properties of the water — the currents, the temperature, the bubbles — even still free to let his attention wander to other matters. We can prove that the bodiless Harry has been conscious by sewing his brain and skin receptors back into his body and asking him about his recent experience. Were you conscious during our experiment, Harry? Hell yes, he replies, and is all this stitching going to leave any scars? He can even describe the experience for us. This is part of the wonder of the human brain: our ability to re-live past experiences to some extent — to re-member (from the Latin re, “again”, and memorari, “be mindful of”).

But consciousness itself is not mysterious. Hot Tub Harry’s consciousness was nothing more than his active observation of both his environment and his cognitive activities while his brain was immersed in a nutrient bath and connected to a sense organ.

But where, you ask, is Harry in all this? Who or what is doing all this observing? Is Harry a little homunculus hidden somewhere in his brain? Absolutely not. There is no homunculus, and there is also no Harry. The entity that calls itself “Harry” is just a curious property of this entity’s consciousness — a kind of bonus that comes from our ability to remember our past: Although our brains change continuously throughout our lives, the changes are generally small enough so that we retain a sense of continuity from one minute to the next, even from one year to the next. The sense of continuity creates the illusion of “self” or “I” or “me.”

As real as the self feels, however, it is truly just an illusion — one that is vulnerable to disruption. Psychedelic drugs, a head injury, oxygen deprivation, mental illness, disease and aging can all degrade the sense of self, even obliterate it completely. I have met people in clinical settings who have completely lost their sense of self; it is painfully sad. Are such people conscious? Yes, but because they have no identity and very little past, their conscious experience is limited mainly to the observation of their current environment.

Although the self is an illusion, consciousness is not, and, contrary to popular opinion, it is also not “subjective.” To call it so demeans the experience unjustifiably. Seeing is quite real; it has clear physical correlates that can be measured. The fact that the owner of the brain who is doing the seeing has an experience no one else can share is beside the point; his or her experience is no less real. The experience is distinct mainly because the brain owner is part of the system that is doing the seeing. The experience is also a bit odd because the owner, being part of the system, can not only see; he or she can also see him- or herself seeing. The physical correlates of his or her self-observation might be hard to find, but they are presumably findable.

So here is my question for you: Are you something more than a brain floating in a nutrient bath and connected to a body and sense organs — an organic system that interacts with the world? If so, how exactly are you something more, and how can you prove that?

The model I am describing may not be attractive (except for the hot tub, maybe), but I believe it accounts fully for consciousness, at least as I experience it. Consciousness is the brain owner’s experience of observing the world and his or her own body and behavior. This experience seems remarkable mainly because of the convenient ways the brain irons out stimuli, but the smoothing process, as I said, is almost certainly an evolutionary imperative for the brains of many species. The brain stabilizes images, fills in gaps, and sometimes integrates separate stimuli into orderly wholes, but none of these things is miraculous. We build cameras that stabilize images and software applications that integrate and transform diverse media components any way we like. If we can build such things, so can evolution.

As for the “unconscious” — the mythical, reified world popularized by Sigmund Freud — while we are capable of observing the world around us and some aspects of our own behavior and cognitive activity, our observation powers are also limited. We behave and change and learn all the time without explicitly observing such things, and we also are terrible at explaining why we behave as we do. Our limited abilities are just that. They are not evidence that another world — an “unconscious” one — exists to complement the non-existent “conscious” world. Reifying our observational experience was bad enough; inventing yet another non-physical world to explain what our observations can’t make sense of is truly absurd.

This brings me to Henry and Tiny Bryan, my family’s cat and dog, respectively. The never-ending and largely pointless debate about the nature of consciousness has occasionally been extended to animals. Are animals conscious? I cannot share the conscious experiences of Henry or Tiny Bryan any more than I can share yours, but I have no doubt that virtually all vertebrates are conscious very much as humans are. If they can observe the world around them, if they can observe their own bodies, and if they show signs of being able to remember things, then they are conscious — lacking only the linguistic tools to reflect upon and analyze their existence. Charles Darwin said as much in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872).

In some respects, some non-human animals are probably more conscious than we are, either because their sense organs are more sensitive or because they have senses we lack. Some birds can directly detect properties of the earth’s magnetic field; elephants can detect subtle seismic signals; sharks, platypuses, and electric eels can sense electrical fields. What we have in common with all of them is that each of us is a brain floating in a nutrient bath and connected to a body and sense organs. Whatever the species, the brain owner in such a system is probably conscious during most of its waking hours.

Alas, even with all the extra cortical tissue that distinguishes us from lesser beings in the animal kingdom, humans do not think clearly. We are highly prone to errors of thinking — reification, autocentrism, and cognicentrism being just three of our many weaknesses. We are easily swayed, especially by authority figures, and once we have adopted some belief, we attend selectively to evidence that supports that belief, no matter how shoddy it may be (a phenomenon called “confirmation bias”). This means that the perspective I have described in this essay will not only be difficult for many people to accept, it will also draw criticism from “experts” whose careers, reputations, and livelihoods depend on defending their own positions, no matter how weak, cumbersome, or absurd. (The whole universe is conscious? Give me a break.) Over the course of the 40 years since I entered graduate school in psychology, I have known of only one major figure in my field who recanted a theory he had been staunchly defending for much of his career — more than 20 years in this case. This remarkable shift was an exception to the rule; when academicians develop and defend a theory, it is almost always to the death.

Although I think I am right about consciousness, I do not expect people to rally round me in support. Our immediate experience, combined with a long history of brainwashing — um, sorry, I mean education — tells us, mistakenly, that consciousness is both mysterious and non-physical and that our “self” is every bit as real as our driver’s license. Immediate experience, again combined with brainwashing, also told people for millennia that the world was flat, and millions of people still believe that today. We may be conscious, but are we smart enough to admit what consciousness really is?",https://medium.com/the-awl/the-simple-truth-about-consciousness-7b551473a171,Robert Epstein,2017-05-11 17:25:14.657000+00:00,"Neuroscience,Brain,Consciousness,Editors Pick,Science"
Thinking About Software Sustainably,"Thinking About Software Sustainably

I know what you’re thinking: “Here we go again with all the sustainability buzzwords,” but hear me out

Sustainability is not just about preserving the environment. That’s only a part of it.

According to a report by the World Commission on Environment and Development, sustainability is about the capacity to endure. This is something us software developers should be very interested in. We are problem-solvers and builders. Of course, we want our creations — or at the very least our jobs — to last.

Thinking about how we can build sustainable software is a good way to do that.

“Sustainability of a system describes how well the system will continue to exist and function, even as circumstances may change.” — Becker et. al.

The question for us software developers is, how can we design and build software so it can deal with change?

This is also why, implicitly, we are already focusing on building sustainable software. By trying to ensure maintainability, scalability, and all the other -ilities, we’re trying to create software that can stand the test of time. It’s just good sense. However, there are more perspectives involved than just technical sustainability.

Various academic papers have actually identified four perspectives for sustainable software:

Economic sustainability

Environmental sustainability

Social sustainability

Technical sustainability

These might not be all-encompassing, but they cover the majority of software-related sustainability concerns.",https://medium.com/better-programming/thinking-about-software-sustainably-ebdc0d9b0f23,Johanne Andersen,2020-06-15 13:37:56.929000+00:00,"Sustainability,Startup,Software Engineering,Programming,Software Development"
John Frusciante Rejoins Red Hot Chili Peppers: What About The Other Guy?,"Josh Klinghoffer has already had his worst week ever. Today is only Tuesday.

He played guitar for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He was the youngest person ever admitted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was only 32 at the band’s 2012 induction. That was on Saturday.

The Chili Peppers fired him on Sunday. His replacement? John Frusciante. The man Klinghoffer replaced ten years ago.

He confirmed the news to fans, one of whom tweeted, “Josh is happy for them,” meaning the Chili Peppers. Marbelle, or, at least, that was their Twitter handle, added, “I’m sure he’s hurting though. We will be there for him.”

How Weighted Blankets Can Help Improve Your Mental Health,"How Weighted Blankets Can Help Improve Your Mental Health

Sleep is closely related to our mental state

Sleep is closely related to our mental state. When we aren’t able to sleep well, we are often more easily frustrated and experience a drop in productivity. When lack of sleep (or poor quality sleep) occurs for prolonged periods, we might even start to feel a strain on our mental health.

Amongst methods like using calming essential oils, yoga, and sleeping pills, weighted blankets are a common solution many have turned to in an effort to solve their sleep-related woes.

What is a weighted blanket?

In short, a weighted blanket is a heavy blanket that weighs anywhere between 5 pounds to 30 pounds (around 2 kilograms to 13.5 kilograms).

Originally devised to help older children that fall on the autism spectrum, weighted blankets have also helped improve sleep quality.

Weighted blankets can be used to help reduce anxiety and stress, making it a great way for one to subtly improve one’s mental health without having to make radical changes in one’s lifestyle.

The benefits of using weighted blankets

A weighted blanket applies a “deep pressure” on the user, engaging a kind of stimulation called Deep Touch Pressure (DTP) Stimulation. When studied, DTP provides positive effects by reducing the anxiety one feels. Furthermore, the weighted blanket helps users feel relaxed and more comfortable, helping improve sleep quality.

Apart from reducing anxiety, DTP encourages our bodies to release oxytocin. This hormone works to help with stress coping, allowing one to relax and fostering a positive mood.

The use of weighted chain blankets by patients with diagnosed psychiatric disorders was found to help significantly with insomnia, allowing the patients to reduce the fatigue, depression, and anxiety felt during the day, resulting in an increase in daytime activity level.

Is a weighted blanket suitable for me?

While I hope everyone can enjoy the benefits of a weighted blanket and be able to sleep in the warm hug of one, it’s not suitable for everyone.

Individuals with sleep apnea, respiratory problems, claustrophobia, and other chronic medical conditions should check with a trained medical professional before using the blanket.

Also, a weighted blanket should not be used for young children.",https://medium.com/2-minute-madness/how-weighted-blankets-can-help-improve-your-mental-health-b60543aa8add,Jerren Gan,2020-12-10 15:38:16.848000+00:00,"Health,Self Improvement,Sleep,Mental Health,Science"
