Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!

We just wanted everyone to know how much we appreciate everyone and how thankful we are for all our readers and writers here. We wouldn’t be anywhere without you, so thank you all for bringing informative, vulnerable, and important pieces that destigmatize mental illness and mental health.

Without further ado, here are ten of our top stories from last week, all of which were curated:

“Just as the capacity to love and inspire is universal so is the capacity to hate and discourage. Irrespective of gender, race, age or religion none of us are exempt from aggressive proclivities. Those who are narcissistically disordered, and accordingly repress deep seated feelings of inferiority with inflated delusions of grandeur and superiority, are more prone to aggression and violence. They infiltrate our interactions in myriad environments from home, work, school and the cyber world. Hence, bullying does not happen in isolation. Although there is a ringleader she looks to her minions to either sanction her cruelty or look the other way.”

“Even though the circumstances that brought me here were sad and challenging, I’m grateful for how this program has changed my life for the better. I can’t help but imagine what life would be like if everyone learned to accept their powerlessness over other people, prioritize their serenity, and take life one step at a time. We’ll never know, but I’d bet the world would be much happier.”

“The prospect of spending a horrible Christmas, locked in on a psychiatric unit, was one of the low points of my life. For weeks, the day room was festooned with cheesy decorations and a sorry pink aluminum tree. All of our “activity” therapies revolved around the holidays. We baked and decorated cookies. We fashioned quick-drying clay into ornaments that turned out to be too heavy for the tree. Crappy Christmas carols were background torture. It was hard to get pissed off at the staff because they were making the best with what they had.”

“Although I hate to admit it, even if my ex had never betrayed me, I still wouldn’t have been happy. I had set him up for an impossible job — to define me and make me whole. If I cannot find peace and contentment within myself, how could anyone else do it for me?”

“On a personal note, significant feelings of loss and sadness can still flare up from time to time. That’s only natural; it’s no reason for self-critique. No matter how resilient we purport to be, we are all emotionally vulnerable human beings. Besides, we aren’t talking about some conceptual loss that we can just mechanically compartmentalize away — we are talking about the loss of our fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers.”

“The next six weeks will be hard as cases continue to explode and government leadership remains nonexistent. I can’t control any of this. The only thing I can do is take deep breaths, remain vigilant when it comes to limiting exposure to the virus, and let lots of stuff go. I may always be a hypochondriac, but now that I recognize the beast, I’m hopeful I’ll be able to tame it.”

“From anecdotal news reports and informal surveys, there is evidence that for some of us, this pandemic-imposed isolation is a boon rather than a trial. One study on mixed emotions showed that those with lower emotional stability (“moody” personalities) are actually better at responding to uncertainty.”

“Every day I wish in my heart and soul that I didn’t have ME/CFS. Unfortunately, I do. It’s a result of a virus I had; 10–12 percent of people who experience a serious infection go on to develop ME. I’ve visualized life without CFS for over a year now; I can smell life without it, I can taste it. It’s in the smell of the lavender fields that I can no longer run through. It’s in the taste of the meals from my favorite restaurant that I can no longer walk to. It’s on the tip of my tongue. It’s in the potentialities; all the things I could be doing, as a twenty-four year-old, that I can’t. I cannot cross the chasm between the potential and the reality. And that’s nothing to do with manifestation.”

“Whether it’s cabin fever, redundancy, loss, or general Covid anxieties, this year has caused us to be exposed to more uncertainty than ever. Uncertainty creates unease and feelings of stress. Some of us may have taken this year as one to motivate — plan dream trips, and prepare and be inspired for what the future could bring. For the rest, it has caused us to become irrational, emotional, and reserved.

“To be more self-compassionate is a task that can be tricky because we always want to push ourselves and do better. Without realising it, this can lead to us being self-critical which can have damaging consequences.

It’s important to notice these times when we are harsh because we can easily turn it into self-compassion, which is linked to a better quality of life.”

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!

A guide to the curious and troubling impact of the pandemic and isolation

The coronavirus pandemic frustrates and confounds epidemiologists and immunologists, even after months of study. It frustrates politicians and public health officials dealing with mask non-compliance. It frustrates everyone stuck at home, whether they lost their job or adapting to Zoom.

After exposure to the virus, it first enters the lungs, using host machinery to replicate. The virus itself is just a genetic sequence enclosed in a protein and lipid coat. It binds the ACE2 receptors on lung cells, with a spike protein located on its protein-lipid coat. This receptor, attached to the virus, trafficks into the lung cell. Here the virus hijacks the machinery of the cell to replicate, damaging lung tissue and spreading throughout the body.

The ACE2 receptor, expressed in many regions of the body, is vulnerable to further entry of these viral particles. The ACE2 receptor regulates blood pressure, nutrient absorption and inflammation. These pathways converge and mediate brain health and disease.

The novel coronavirus perplexed us for many different reasons. A large majority of people who get it don’t display any symptoms, while some display symptoms for many months and others require ventilators to breathe. It is unclear whether someone infected with coronavirus retains long-term immunity.

Also, troubling findings implicate this disease in the induction of stroke and the worsening of mental health. The realization that there are likely long-term complications of coronavirus infection is worrying, as millions of people may require expensive coverage for this new pre-existing condition.

Those of us lucky to avoid being infected become more socially isolated and lonely. Many studies report the worsening of mental health symptoms, especially in frontline workers, nurses and doctors. These professionals are more prone to burning out and require extra care.

COVID-19 and Stroke

The cells in the brain require a disproportionate amount of energy to function. When deprived of oxygen, even for minutes, the cells begin to die, leading to a variety of debilitating sensory, motor or language deficits depending. When there is blood loss to a specific region of the brain, cells cannot use oxygen to generate energy. If there is a clot in an artery, fresh oxygen cannot travel to any regions primarily supplied by that blood vessel. These events, classified as ischemic strokes, cause lifelong disability in some of those afflicted.

Early findings in patients found abnormal clotting in blood vessels. Vessels around the lungs or even arterial blood-flow to the brain is interrupted. Thus, individuals infected with coronavirus who suffered abnormal blood clotting as a result, were at higher risk of stroke.

In June of 2020, researchers published a report of neurological symptoms in the New England Journal of Medicine. While they did not report common symptoms of having a stroke, they showed other strange brain-related features. Of thirteen COVID-19 patients who underwent brain imaging, three of them showed signs of an ischemic stroke. A subset of eight of these patients showed other types of inflammation, while eleven presented with a lack of blood flow to the frontal areas of the brain.

Though a preliminary observational study, it suggested that the coronavirus impacted blood clotting and flow to the brain. Several studies since identified swathes of patients suffering from ischemic strokes or brain/vascular inflammation. Another study reviewed the current state of evidence, concluding that 41% of patients suffering from neurological symptoms after COVID-19 infection, suffered from strokes. Larger studies however, are needed to decipher how common this is among all those infected with the novel coronavirus.

Depending on which region of the brain loses oxygen, stroke may manifest as a broad range of symptoms. If cells die in an area of the brain responsible for motor movement, it later manifests in unilateral or bilateral difficulties with movement. Other common symptoms involve fatigue, challenges with balance or walking, partial paralysis, pain or inattention to one entire side of the body. It prevents individuals from doing the things they do in their daily lives, such as dress themselves or go to the bathroom independently.

COVID-19 and Psychiatric Disorders

Either through neuroimmune signalling or by directly entering the cells of the brain, COVID-19 also contributes to psychiatric symptoms and disorders. It is unclear what role it may play in their pathology, but it may worsen existing conditions or as a contributing factor in its development.

One study compared individuals afflicted with the novel coronavirus to those in quarantine or the general public, finding elevated rates of depression (29.2%) in those with COVID-19. Another small study reported increased post-traumatic stress symptoms in these patients.

Individuals already living with psychiatric disorders reported a worsening of symptoms in two different studies. Several other studies reported depressive and anxious symptoms worsened among essential workers.

Another study surveyed >2000 individuals in Denmark, finding a reduction in overall psychological well-being measures during the pandemics. This study also reported that women were more negatively affected than men.

Additionally, it recognized that many older adults living in adult-care communities during shelter-in-place orders experience loneliness and depression. A study of older adults in San Francisco found that they showed increased rates of loneliness and depression.

We must do our best to check-up on our friends and loved ones. We are all affected differently by the pandemic, so it is important to recognize that the rates of anxiety, depression and stress-related disorders may arise.

COVID-19 Long-Haulers

Thousands of individuals initially infected with COVID-19, the long-haulers, continue to suffer symptoms many months later. On average, these individuals are women around the age of 44 who are otherwise healthy. Their infections were classified as mild severity because they could recover at home.

Facing stigma and in need of a community, several groups sprouted up to support each other. Originally disbelieved, they rallied to raise awareness of their predicament within the medical establishment. It should no longer be sufficient to classify individuals infected with COVID-19, who don’t require a hospital stay, as mild.

A few different studies report that most individuals affected with COVID-19 suffer from symptoms months later (Italy, UK, Germany). Intriguingly, many long-haulers did not produce high-levels of coronavirus antibodies. Many individuals experience pain, fatigue and many other debilitating symptoms.

These symptoms are consistent with disturbances in the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for many automatic physiological functions like breathing or heart-rate but also influence fatigue. Preliminary physiotherapy involves reconditioning the nervous system of patients so that they may regain some of these functions.

Mind Your Nose,"Mind Your Nose

How smell training can change your brain in six weeks — and why it matters.

By Ann-Sophie Barwich

When it comes to training your brain, your sense of smell is possibly the last thing you’d think could strengthen your neural pathways. Learning a new language or reading more books (and fewer social media posts) — sure. But your nose?

That’s because the olfactory system is one of the most plastic systems in your brain. Neuroplasticity describes how the brain flexibly adapts to changes in the environment or when exposed to neural damage. Stimulating the brain strengthens existing neural structures and further adds fuel to the brain’s capacity to remain adaptive, thereby keeping it young. And your smell system is particularly adept at repair and renewal. (Olfactory cells have recently been used in human transplant therapy to treat spinal cord injury, for example.)

One reason for the olfactory system’s adaptive responsiveness is that it undergoes adult neurogenesis. Humans grow new olfactory neurons every three to four weeks throughout their entire life, not just during child development. (These sensory neurons sit in the mucous of your nose, where they pick up airborne chemicals and send activity signals straight to the core of the brain.) If it weren’t for this ongoing regeneration of sensory cells in your nose, we would stop detecting smells after our first few colds.

Neural plasticity weakens as we grow old — and so does our sense of smell. Olfactory performance decreases around the age of 70 as the regeneration of olfactory neurons slows down. Yet this process of regeneration never stops entirely. Training your nose helps slow down that decline and offers a great way to increase your brain’s plasticity. That said, increasing your sensitivity to odors in the environment does not always sound desirable. Smell usually comes with negative connotations: that whiff of urine in the metro, that overpowering literal skunk, or that trail of body odor from the person walking in front of you. But paying more attention to the smells around you also has benefits, and not just for a greater enjoyment of food aromas and neighbors’ gardens.

Recent studies show that olfactory abilities correspond with differences in cortical areas involved in smell processing in the brain. Johannes Frasnelli, an olfactory scientist at the University of Quebec in Trois-Rivières, explained: “We did some studies where we saw that there is a link between the structure of certain brain regions-like the thickness of the cortex and the thickness of the gray matter layer in certain brain olfactory processing regions-and the ability to perceive.” Frasnelli and his colleagues found that people with better perceptual capacities had a thicker cortex. When they looked at people who had lost their sense of smell, they also saw a reduction of cortical matter in areas involved in odor processing.

That raises the question: Could you change the structure of your brain simply by smelling things? In 2019, Frasnelli’s group discovered that undergoing as little as six weeks of intense olfactory training results in significant structural changes in some regions of the brain (namely, the right inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral fusiform gyrus, and the right entorhinal cortex).

Participants were given three tasks with a cognitive component.

The first task was a classification task. Participants had to organize two simple odor mixtures by ordering each from lowest to highest concentration. The second was an identification task. Participants were presented with a target odor blended with a citrus scent in a specific ratio (4%). Then they were given the same blend in different ratios and asked to order them according to quality (more citrusy or less?). Lastly, the detection task: Was the learned target odor present in a range of 14 samples of different odor mixtures or not?

This entire exercise was undertaken each day for 20 minutes during the six weeks. Responses were monitored and evaluated on speed and accuracy.

Such intense olfactory training led to a general improvement in olfactory performance. Plus, the increase of olfactory skill was not restricted to the training exercises but also transferred to other olfactory abilities-abilities that had not been tested as part of the training. These perceptual tests included: the detection threshold of an odor, accuracy in odor discrimination (same or different?), cued odor identification (which of these four descriptors is correct?), and even free odor identification (identifying an odor without cues!).

Increasing insight into what the nose knows, and how it communicates with the brain, has broader implications-even philosophical ones. Old (yet still prevalent) cookie-cutter views of the mind coax us to believe that our senses are passive-indifferently picking up signals in the world that are then processed by the brain. Perception, in such views, is a process separate from cognition. Highly plastic systems such as olfaction present us with a much more intriguing and interwoven picture of the mind: Training your nose’s performance (just like other cognitive capacities) fundamentally shapes what you perceive by rewiring the system.

Your senses are far from being impartial transmitters; what you are able to perceive in the world ultimately hinges on the depth of your cognitive engagement with it. In other words, your mind does not emerge apathetically as a product of some remarkable, intricate molecular twists performed by the brain. The mind is enhanced by what you can train your brain to do. Just like strength is a result of muscle training, cognitive training of the senses is the bodybuilding of the brain.",https://medium.com/neodotlife/mind-your-nose-f0b097d533bb,,2020-10-10 20:17:37.132000+00:00,"Biotechnology,Neuroscience,Brain,Wellness,Science"

Surviving a Rod Through the Head,"You’ve heard of him, haven’t you? Phineas Gage. The railroad worker who survived an explosion that involved an iron rod piercing through his left cheek and out of his brain and skull.

Yeah.

I know.

You’re probably wondering “yeah, alright sweet. What about him?” Well, let’s just say that he was a really popular patient for the field of neuroscience (Cherry, par. 1). And what I found the most interesting about this tragic event was the science of his behavior afterward.

For those of you who don’t know much about Phineas Gage, let me fill you in with the help of my research.

Phineas Gage, 25 years old, was a railroad worker in Vermont. One day, at work, he was using an iron rod to handle explosive gun powder. As he was using the iron rod to handle the gun powder, an explosion suddenly occurred. The iron rod then went through his left cheek and brain. Fortunately, he survived and was able to talk and walk after the accident (Cherry, par. 2–3).

Why did people say that Phineas Gage was a “different person” after his accident? It actually has to do with neuroscience.

The iron rod went through his brain, in particular, it went through the frontal lobe of his brain. Does this mean that the frontal lobe of your brain has to do with the kind of person you are? To answer this question, we have to understand what the frontal lobe in our brain is responsible for.

Our frontal lobes are responsible for many things. Some of them are higher-order thinking, personality, and decision making. This explains why people who knew Phineas Gage said that he was a totally different person after the accident. Since the iron rod went through his frontal lobe, it means that his personality and thinking, as a whole, completely changed, making him seem like he was a whole different person due to the way he started acting.

This accident and the treatment of Phineas Gage actually played a big role in the field of neurology. His case helped scientists better understand the role of the frontal cortex of the brain (Cherry, par. 16–17).

"Mentally, Young Adults Are Suffering Most From COVID","Mentally, Young Adults Are Suffering Most From COVID

“When it comes to having a painful feeling, the only way out is through.”

“Young individuals reported higher acute stress and depressive symptoms than older respondents, suggesting that despite being most deadly for older populations at the time of our data collection, the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have had widespread impacts across populations.” — Holman et al., Science Advances 2020

It’s no secret that COVID-19 and the pandemic have been detrimental to people’s mental health. However, the group that’s suffered the most from COVID-19 is young adults, who have had the biggest mental toll from COVID. Holman et al. found that 62.9 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds reported an anxiety or depressive disorder, and a quarter found they were using more than alcohol or drugs to cope with their pandemic stress. The researchers found that a quarter of the age group “seriously considered suicide” between mid-March to mid-April.

The conclusion from those findings is that young people are suffering most mentally from COVID. Unfortunately, I don’t find these findings that surprising. I know a lot of people struggle with COVID. I’m struggling with COVID, and I’m in that age range of 18- to 24-year-olds — and I experience that phenomenon as much as anyone in my age range.

But Claudia Wallis at Scientific American reports on more than just the mental health of youth mental health during COVID. A report from the CDC in August found that incidences of anxiety symptoms tripled and depression quadrupled in a representative sample. And the most affected are people who had pre-existing mental health issues, people of color, and low-income individuals, so the vulnerable individuals in society are more vulnerable during the pandemic.

Interestingly enough, Ettman et al. found that Asian individuals saw an almost fivefold increase in depression, and some psychiatrists who talked to Wallis attributed that to racism and slurs related to the Asian-Americans. As an Asian-American, the pandemic is forcing me to confront anti-Asian racism in a way I’ve never done so before. According to Holman et al., young people may have been more depressed because:

“[They] may have had more disruption in life events: graduations, weddings, the senior year of college and of high school. All those transitions were disrupted, as well as school and social connections, which we know are very important for young people.”

And the researchers also found that increased exposure to media coverage about the coronavirus led to more distress. Sensationalist reports lead to more anxiety and depression, and clearly the lack of social connection also disproportionately affects young people. Psychologist Logan Jones stresses that much of the reporting these days keeps people hooked on the news cycle, and keeps people addicted to the news. As such, Jones emphasizes the importance of keeping boundaries.

“Consuming too much of this kind of news, whether actively or passively, can be very toxic, and what you hear has an impact on your mood,” Jones says.

The CDC also states that the mental health of young adults has been impacted socially, emotionally, and mentally. They attribute these mental health concerns to the trauma faced at a developmental age, and all hands are on deck for parents, caregivers, and other adults to support children and young people. Part of that trauma is a result of changes in routines, employment, and educational challenges, a loss of security and safety, and missed significant life events.

As a teacher during COVID, almost all of my students say they want to return to the physical school building during COVID. They report being more lonely and isolated, and can’t wait to return to see their friends and teachers again. My school is emphasizing more relationship-building activities and prioritizing mental health during lessons more than adhering to a curriculum as a result.

Takeaways

Well, the problem is difficult and can seem negative, but what can young people do to tackle mental health concerns during COVID?

The CDC states that to fight stress during COVID, young people need to recognize and address fear, stress, and behavioral changes during COVID. Health concerns are certainly a priority for young people as well, and excessive worry and sadness leads to trouble paying attention, trouble concentrating, and trouble focusing on activities.

It is also important for young people to stay socially connected. Staying socially connected through video chats, Zoom, and phone calls is also a solution.

But honestly, we’re all doing the best we can, and it’s very important to recognize that as we go through our days. Whatever we’re going through is valid and reasonable, and above all, normal.

For me, what’s helped my mental health is spending time with my girlfriend and my friends within reason, limiting how much I doomscroll, and get enough sleep. I try to exercise and maintain a fitness challenge, but what works for me certainly won’t work for everyone.

Unicef emphasizes that it’s important to feel your feelings instead of trying to resist them, as well.

How to Turn Your Popular Blog Series Into a Bestselling Book,"How to Turn Your Popular Blog Series Into a Bestselling Book

Thoughts from someone who’s done it five times

Photo by John Schnobrich on Unsplash

Every serious writer’s dream is to see their name on a bestselling book — one that people eagerly read, review, and tell their friends about.

Is that your dream?

It can come true. Your words can reach further and do more good than you ever imagined.

You’re already here on Medium writing for the masses. Maybe you have a blog, too. I’ll bet you’ve noticed it’s infinitely easier to get traffic here than it is on your own property.

Why is that?

When it’s your own place, you have to invite people to come. They won’t necessarily see you when they’re surfing the web, looking for content like yours. The keywords might bring your site to the top if you’ve done your homework and bought a few (or a lot of) ads. If you’ve got a hefty budget to spend before you make a dime, that can be a great way to go.

But what if you don’t?

Hope for those on a limited budget

When you first start out, you’ve got a big dream. You know your story is good. You know it can change people’s lives. It doesn’t matter if it’s truth or fiction. The truth is, even fiction has a bit of truth in it. If it didn’t, it would be fantasy. We need things to make sense, even in a made up world or we can’t follow what’s happening, much less believe it enough to read it.

I write nonfiction, most of the time, so what I share here will come from that perspective. If you’re a storyteller, there are still principles here you can use to promote your work. So stay with me, okay?

The beauty of writing on a platform like Medium is you don’t have to spend a dime to get paid. You do have to spend time — and we all have some of that. Here’s how you’ll spend it:

Brainstorming ideas

Refining those ideas into drafts

Editing your writing for prime time

Sharing a bit on social media, your own work and the work of others

You can cash in on community when you contribute something valuable to it. The more valuable it is, the more likely others will read it, comment on it, and share it. When you do the same for others, some will want to pay you back.

Generosity is the key to growth.

Write to learn what people want

A book is an ambitious project.

Some say it takes a year or more. Others say you can write a book a week. I’m not sure I advocate either of these approaches.

I say writing a book should take long enough for it to be effective. Depending on your subject and how much time you have, that could take three months or nine months. If you know a lot up front, the process will be shorter. If you have to do a lot of research, budget that time in.

So what makes a book effective? How do you answer that question?

Photo by bruce mars on Unsplash

First, your book is effective when it satisfies a reader’s need.

What do your readers want? If you have a following, you already know, don’t you? They probably want a few things like:

Entertainment

Information

Hope

An escape

Chances are, they want a mix of these things. As you blog, invite your readers to talk to you. Use that feedback to discover what’s missing in their lives that they want more of. Then you can take on the responsibility to provide it to them.

If they feel the need strongly enough, they’ll buy.

Second, your book is effective when it fills a gap.

Don’t just write another leadership book because people buy a lot of them.

The same goes for romance, historical fiction, writing advice, or whatever your speciality is.

Give them something they can’t get anywhere else.

How do you figure out what’s missing?

Read a few other books, preferably the bestsellers. What do they cover? How well do they do it? What might you do even better than this author?

Scan the reviews. Is there something people want that the book doesn’t cover? Is there something people complain about that you can make irrelevant in your book? Read the most popular reviews, positive and negative. Make notes. Then use what you learn to make your book shine.

Talk to people who’ve read these books if you can. Ask them what they liked about them, and what they didn’t. What do they wish the author had covered that he didn’t? What did the author include that they think should have been left out?

Feel free to reward those who help you with a free copy of your awesome book.

Third, test your material in blog posts and refine it in the book.

Before you write your draft in silence and refine it for your book, why not test it with the people who already read your content?

You’ll learn a lot this way:

Whether your readers think your idea is as good as you do

What questions they have about your content

How clearly and persuasively you’re making your points

Wouldn’t you rather know this before you spend a year in front of your desk writing your masterpiece? Better to let it walk in public first before it runs on the digital presses.

If you’re worried people might not buy your book when they can read it online, here’s a bit of insurance to nudge them forward — include some surprises in the book that they can’t get anywhere else.

Also, you don’t have to transfer it word for word if you don’t want to. You’ll probably need to add some transitions so it all flows together. This will become clearer as you work through your blog series.

By the time you’re done, you’ll have a book that already took a test drive before you hit publish. There’s no guarantee you’ll be the number one bestseller, but you’ll sure have a better shot than you will with a book you write on speculation.

When you already have a following, at least some of them will be eager to buy your book on day one.

Finally, it’s not all about you

There are so many people trying to sell something now it’s ridiculous.

And yeah, I know, I’m asking you to be one more of them.

You can set yourself apart by focusing on service. Sure, you’ve gotta get paid. We all need to eat. You soften the blow when you provide more value than what it costs to get that value. People are already spending money on books, courses, and the like. They buy when they believe what they’re getting is more valuable than the cash in their pocket.

When you test drive your book on your blog, you can establish value as you go. Each post should add to the overall value of the total package. With all that going for you, you’ll have no guilt. Marketing won’t feel so slimy. You know your book is good, and you can stand behind it with honest pride.

Make it about them and they’ll make your dream come true.

Do that and I’ll see you on the bestseller list!",https://frankmckinley.medium.com/want-to-turn-your-blog-into-a-book-6360e4b1d670,Frank Mckinley,2020-01-28 03:36:58.566000+00:00,"Books,Entrepreneurship,Writing,Marketing,Productivity"

Dr. Fasial Dar is the pioneer of liver transplantation in Pakistan. He works at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad where he conducted the first ever transplant in 2010 of a 9 year old boy. Recently, along with his team he has successfully completed 200 transplant surgeries in Pakistan.

Fatima Arif: Give us some of your personal background; your family and education background.

Dr. Faisal Dar: I was born in Faisalabad; but due to my father’s death when I was very young; my family decided to move back to our native village, Kotla Bhalot, in

Kharian, District Gujrat. There I completed my basic education from a local school, leading to Matric and F.Sc from Kharian Cantt.

My MBBS is from Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore. After that I completed my FCPS (surgery): Fellow of College of Physicians & Surgeons from Pakistan. Then I went to Ireland for my FRCS (Surgery) Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. This was followed by Fellowship in Liver Transplantation/Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery from Kings College London School of Medicine, UK. Additionally, I am also a Fellow of European Board in Transplant Surgery (FEBTS — Transplant Surgery).

FA: When did you decide to become a doctor, was it a personal choice or like the majority here your parents idea and how did you decide to opt for this specialty?

FD: My family wanted me to join Pakistan Army; becoming a doctor was my own choice. Since I qualified the merit list for medical college; so it was easy to convince my family to let me follow my calling.

Surgery was my passion since the start and that is why after completing my house job I decided to go for my fellowship in general surgery. After completing my training and exams I went to UK for further specialization in 2003. At that time there was no liver transplant and hepatopancreaticobiliary surgeons in Pakistan and considering the huge need for this facility in our country I decided to opt this specialty.

FA: Share your journey of how the liver transplants started and what is the procedure whereby patients are selected?

FD: The first liver transplant in humans was done in 1963. Liver transplant went through two decades of evolution and scientific work, and it was only in 1983 when liver transplant was accepted as the standard treatment for liver failure. Since then huge number of liver transplants are carried out across the world. Living donor liver transplant (in which a healthy individual donates a part of his liver to his beloved one) started in early 1990’s; the techniques and procedures got matured by 2000, and now living donor liver transplant is the standard accepted options for patients with liver failure in countries where donations after brain death does not exists.

After completing my training at King’s College Hospital, London, I decided to come back to Pakistan and start liver transplant program in my country. I was lucky to get good colleagues and tremendous support from the management to get the basic work done before we could do our first liver transplant on 30th April 2010 at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad. Personally it was a very happy and emotional moment and a great honor for me as a doctor to be the pioneer of liver transplantation in Pakistan.

Patients go through an extensive assessment process to determine their candidacy for liver transplant. In short any patient who’s liver has failed either due to a chronic disease (like hepatitis B & C, autoimmune liver diseases etc.) or suffer from acute liver failure (due to hepatitis E, A or other viruses, drugs or toxins) and patients who have developed liver cancer can benefit from liver transplant. Patients who are unfit to go through such a major operation (due to severe heart or lung disease) or patients who have advanced cancer are not considered for liver transplant because they will not benefit in short or long term from liver transplant.

FA: How are patients who can’t afford the procedure included in the process and how is there funding secured?

FD: Liver transplant is one of the most complex operation in the medical field. In order to conduct a liver transplant there are some minimal standards that need to be followed by the hospital. Without these basic set standards and the highest level of skill set it is not possible to do a liver transplant successfully. Someone has to bear the cost of the operation. At the moment majority of the patients pay out of their own pocket. Some are funded by the insurance companies, some by the Government and some by different NGO’s.

Pakistan is a beautiful country. Its natural beauty comprising of landscapes, deserts, rivers, planes and the mighty mountains is matchless. The people of Pakistan are loving and caring, known for their hospitality.

FA: What is the future you see for Pakistan’s medical community in terms of the latest treatments and technology?

FD: Technology is not a big issue as the world has become a global village and access to technology has been made easier. The most important factor is the human resource. Pakistan needs expat doctors to come back; transfer knowledge, techniques and train the future generations to the latest available treatments in the world.

FA: Share one inspiring story that you came across over the period of your career that had a lasting impact on you?

FD: The story that had an impact on me and is close to my heart is from our first liver transplant at Shifa International Hospital. The patient, Muhammad Yasin, a 9 year old boy who was in a need of liver transplant. He was the only son after seven daughters, and none of the family members had a matching blood group for them to donate a part of their liver to save his life. It was his 21 years old cousin; Humaira; a university student who volunteered herself to go through an operation to save her cousin’s life. The courage of this young girl, the bond of the family and the faith they had on us was amazing. It has been three years down the line both, Yasin and Humaira are living a normal life.

FA: Pakistan faces brain drain, specifically in the medical field. What is your take on it and in your opinion what is the solution to this problem?

FD: Personally, I think Pakistani doctors need to go abroad to get exposure to the Western world, that not only enhances their medical knowledge, but it grooms them. Furthermore this exposure adds to their confidence while at the same time teaches them better patient care procedures.

However, I also believe that these doctors after improving their skills should come back and serve Pakistan. A lot of responsibility also lies on the Government to improve the public sector hospitals and to redefine service structure for doctors. If our hospitals are upgraded and the doctors are offered decent salaries, I think a lot of doctors will prefer coming back home.

FA: What is your message to the international community about Pakistan, where you would like to change at least one stereotype about the country and its people?

FD: Pakistan is a beautiful country. Its natural beauty comprising of landscapes, deserts, rivers, planes and the mighty mountains is matchless. The people of Pakistan are loving and caring, known for their hospitality.

Our youth is really talented and determine to work for a better future. There are macro level issues, like corruption, bad governance and terrorism that are the obstacles in the materializing of the country’s true potential. I hope to play whatever role I can to help our younger generation break these shekels and realize their dreams.",https://medium.com/storyfest/dr-faisal-dar-pioneer-of-liver-transplantation-in-pakistan-e6f373cb0ea,Fatima Arif,2019-02-28 06:01:04.914000+00:00,"People,Storyfest,Health,Pakistan,Storytelling"
Sunlight — The Natural Supplement For Our Mental Health,"Sunlight — The Natural Supplement For Our Mental Health

The science behind how the sun is related to our mental wellbeing

Yoga, meditation, binaural beats, aroma therapy. All of these are our attempts at improving our mental health. More than ever, this generation has spoken out about mental health issues and have taken considerable steps in order to try and improve our mental health.

Yet, amongst the many techniques that seem to be popular, it’s surprising that being under the sunlight isn’t something that everybody does.

After all, it’s completely free and can be done easily (at least when it isn’t winter).

Sunlight and Serotonin

Experts often associate exposure to sunlight with the release of serotonin. And this has been proven by science.

A study conducted to find the relationship between serotonin, sunlight, and the season found that the rate of serotonin production is directly related to the prevailing duration of bright sunlight. At the same time, as the luminosity of the sunlight increased, the rate of serotonin production also rose rapidly.

Furthermore, it has been reported in Times that autopsy studies found higher levels of serotonin in individuals that passed away in summer than those who did in winter. This difference in serotonin level was attributed to the differing amounts of sunlight available between the two different seasons.

So… exposure to sunlight is associated with the release of serotonin. But what does that have to do with mental health?

Serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine) is actually a neurotransmitter and is known as the natural ‘feel-good’ chemical. This is due to its role as a natural mood stabilizer and its ability to reduce the symptoms of depression.

As such, by increasing the rate of serotonin production, sunlight acts as a natural mood booster, allowing one to feel happier while reducing the negative effects that are often associated with depression.

In fact, in 2018, a study conducted by Chinese researchers found that moderate exposure to sunlight correlates to an improvement in memory and motor learning in mice. While humans might function differently from mice, this study suggests that a similar relation could be happening for us.

Additionally, results from another study also suggested that exposure to sunlight is associated with the cognitive decline one experiences. In this study, the researchers found that individuals with a decreased exposure of sunlight experienced a higher probability of cognitive decline. This was especially true for individuals with existing depression.

Sunlight and Melatonin

Apart from serotonin, sunlight plays a key role in the release of another chemical — melatonin. However, instead of being produced when it is sunny, melatonin is produced when it is dark. The lower the light intensity, the more melatonin secreted.

While serotonin is a feel-good chemical, melatonin is the natural hormone that promotes sleep in our bodies. As it becomes dark, our body secretes more melatonin in order to prepare us for sleep. This means that melatonin is essential to help us regulate our sleep cycles.

However, there is evidence that suggests that shift workers who work through the night (and as such, are less exposed to sunlight) produce less melatonin. Without this sleep producing hormone, one could possibly experience insomnia and low quality sleep from sleep disturbances.

As quality sleep is key to maintaining a healthy mind, exposing yourself to sunlight can help encourage your body to create melatonin, allowing you to get a good night’s rest (and an improved mental state).

Furthermore, normal melatonin secretion is key to maintaining our bodies’ natural circadian rhythm. As a disruption of the natural circadian rhythm is known to increase the risk of depression, going under the sun to maintain healthy levels of melatonin production could be key in helping you keep depression at bay.

Lack of Sunlight Leaves You SAD

With sunlight playing key roles in the creation of serotonin and melatonin, a lack of sunlight can actually lead to a condition called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).

SAD is actually a form of depression that typically affects individuals during the winter seasons (explaining the lethargy and helplessness you might feel when winter comes). While sunlight is not the only factor, it is suggested that SAD primarily affects individuals in winter as one is less likely to be exposed to strong sunlight. And this points to the importance of sunlight exposure. In order to help reduce the possibility of SAD (especially when it isn’t even winter yet), try your best to expose yourself to natural sunlight as much as possible. Who knows, that might just be the key to helping you keep illnesses like SAD at bay.

Sunlight and Vitamin D

Apart from serotonin and melatonin, sunlight plays a key role in helping our bodies synthesize vitamin D. A fat-soluble vitamin, vitamin D promotes calcium absorption (strengthening your bones) while also supporting the immune system.

A lack of vitamin D in one’s body actually increases the risk of osteoporosis, jaundice, and cardiovascular diseases. As physical well being is tied closely to one’s mental health, getting a healthy dose of vitamin D helps protect your mental wellness by maintaining your physical health.

Besides physical health, vitamin D also has a surprising role in mental health as well. Researchers have found that when one has a vitamin D level of below 20 nanograms per millimeter, the risk of depression is raised by as much as 85 percent when compared to individuals with vitamin D levels of more than 30 nanograms per millimeter).

Studies done also suggest that there is a casual relation between taking vitamin D supplements and an improvement in symptoms for those who suffer from depression. As few foods offer vitamin D naturally, going out into the sun might be the best (and easiest) way to help your body get enough vitamin D.

But How Much Sunlight is Enough?

Of course, we’ve all heard warnings that tell us not to go out into the sun. As sunlight is made up of ultraviolet (UV) rays, experts often warn us about prolonged exposure to strong sunlight.

After all, UV rays damage our skin cells, promoting the formation of blemishes and wrinkles while increasing the risk of skin cancer.

However, Dr. James O’Keefe, a cardiologist who studies the relationship between vitamin D and cardiovascular health, believes that we are evolved to be in the presence of direct sun exposure, claiming that having some direct sunlight helps benefit our health greatly.

In fact, WHO has published guidelines regarding the amount of sunlight exposure we should have. With the beneficial effects of sunlight exposure, WHO suggests getting 5–15 minutes of unblocked (e.g. no sunscreen, no long sleeves) sunlight on our face, arms and hands 2–3 times a week.

With more and more of us spending an increased number of time indoors, going out for occasional sunlight exposure can greatly help improve your mental health.

Of course, as UV rays can still cause your skin harm, do keep your direct sunlight exposure short and avoid periods with strong UV radiation (e.g. noon). If you are going to be out in the sun for an extended period of time, protect yourself with sunscreen. And for those with skin conditions, it might be good to ask your doctor for advice before heading out to bask in the sun.",https://medium.com/wholistique/sunlight-the-natural-supplement-for-our-mental-health-7f59d5fa4492,Jerren Gan,2020-12-16 10:47:37.171000+00:00,"Self Improvement,Mental Health,Health,Wellness,Science"
