"I believe I am as conscious as anyone. When I am awake and my eyes are open, I see a stable, colorful, and continuous world all around me, and that world doesn,Äôt wobble when my eyes move. This fact alone suggests that I am experiencing consciousness, because what I am perceiving transcends the visual signals my retinas are receiving. Those signals are messy, in part because eyes move almost continuously and in part because the retina includes an area ,Äî the scotoma ,Äî that doesn,Äôt react to light; it is a blind spot that is somehow getting filled in by my brain.

My other senses also help me perceive a rich and orderly world which is, I am fairly sure, being constructed by my brain ,Äî more evidence that I am ,Äúconscious.,Äů I am also reasonably good ,Äî as good as one can be, anyway, which isn,Äôt very good ,Äî at picturing things from my past: people I used to know, places I have visited, the room I slept in when I was four. I can also imagine things I have never seen, even things that could never exist: the Eiffel Tower upside-down, Donald Trump with three heads, a line of people a mile long waiting to take advantage of the free food offer at the Russian Tea Room in New York (now there is a fantasy).

I also talk to myself a great deal. And, yes, I also experience a wide range of feelings ,Äî as wide, I believe, as anyone feels. At the moment, I am mainly feeling nervous about all the criticism I will get from various ,Äúexperts,Äů about the content of the essay I am now writing.

So, do I qualify? Do I seem to you to be conscious, or at least to be a good liar who knows what to say to convince people I am conscious? Let,Äôs assume the former, at least for the moment, so I can get on with things.

My world has always been full of mysteries, such as: What happens to the thousands of tons of rubber that wear off the tires of our cars and trucks every year? Why isn,Äôt it piling up on the sides of our roads, blocking the views of our houses? And: If I hang upside down every day, will I get taller or at least stop shrinking as I get older?

For much of my adult life, I have also wondered about something that is supposed to be mysterious but that has never seemed so to me: Why, for centuries, have people considered consciousness to be something beyond human understanding? Now don,Äôt get me wrong. By ,Äúpeople,,Äů I don,Äôt mean people in general. Most people don,Äôt think much about consciousness, other than having some dim awareness of the fact that alcohol and drugs screw it up and, of course, that sleep or a good head bashing temporarily turn it off. And then there is death, of course.

No, by ,Äúpeople,,Äů I mean a special class of people who are paid ,Äî at least a few of them are paid ,Äî to sit around and think about everything and then debate each other about their thoughts and then, in some cases, train other people to think about things exactly the same way they do. You know, academics.

For at least two millennia now, such people, and especially the philosophers among them, have insisted (a) that consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries in the world and (b) that they have solved or at least shed light on this mystery, each in his or her own special way. I could at this point try to impress you with what a dedicated scholar I am by summarizing and then criticizing the views of Aristotle and Augustine, Dennett and Descartes, Heidegger and Hume, Hegel and Nagel, Kant and Carnap, James and Jaynes, Plato and Penrose, Russell and Ryle, and on and on and on. The list of scholars who have weighed in on consciousness is so impressive and diverse that sometimes I think people write about consciousness just to get on a list with Plato and Aristotle on it. Perhaps that is why I am writing this article now!

Instead of slogging through the list, however, I will simply suggest you watch a popular 2014 TED talk by the Australian philosopher, David Chalmers ,Äî perhaps the leading consciousness expert in the world. In a mere 18 minutes, he will confirm three things for you: (a) that he believes consciousness is ,Äúthe most mysterious phenomenon in the universe,Äů (not just one of the most mysterious phenomena, and not just on planet Earth), (b) that ,Äúwe are well on our way to a serious theory,Äů of consciousness ,Äî a statement he has repeated in various forms for more than 20 years now, and, unfortunately, (c) that he actually has no idea what consciousness is or how it works. At least that is I how interpret the video; you make up your own mind.

Chalmers is a champion of the ,Äúpanpsychism,Äů view of consciousness, according to which consciousness is a property of everything in the universe ,Äî and since we are part of the universe ,Äî well, there you are. Got it? He also says consciousness is like ,Äúa movie playing in your head.,Äů And then there is Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose,Äôs neural theory of consciousness, according to which consciousness arises from the vibrations of millions of microtubules in the neurons of the brain. Philosopher Patricia Churchland has labeled this the ,Äúpixie dust,Äů theory of consciousness, which I think sums up the flaws of the theory nicely. How does moving consciousness to small structures in brain cells shed any light on it?

Consciousness theorists routinely commit at least one of three analytical errors when formulating their theories ,Äî often, all three. The first is the reification error. That is when we start to treat some phenomenon as a thing, even though it is not. When Einstein and his contemporaries began speculating about the existence of subatomic particles, they were not committing this error; they believed these particles existed, and subsequent research confirmed their speculations in some respects. When we start to treat ,Äúconsciousness,Äů as a thing, however, we are reifying. Consciousness is not a thing, a place, or a world ,Äî more on this later.

The second error is autocentrism, which I define as excessive focusing on the experience of being ,Äúme.,Äů Humans have routinely impeded the progress of science by putting some aspect of themselves into the center of things. In the 1600s, Galileo was punished by the Catholic Church for defending Copernicus,Äô assertion that the earth is not the center of the universe (,Äúgeocentrism,Äů). ,ÄúEurocentrism,,Äů which, among other things, means imposing European values on the rest of the world, has distorted thinking and theories in anthropology, sociology, literature, and other fields. Psychology, my own field, was troubled by another kind of centrism called ,Äúanthropomorphism,Äů ,Äî the attributing of human characteristics to nonhumans. We just love focusing on ourselves, sometimes to our detriment.

The third error is an extreme form of autocentrism I call cognicentrism: focusing specifically on the importance of one,Äôs own cognitive experiences, as if one,Äôs thought processes had some special significance. Modern scientific psychology was launched in 1879 by a cognicentric German scientist named Wilhelm Wundt, who believed that a science of cognition was possible. Wundt, in turn, had been influenced by the work of another German scientist, Gustav Fechner, who had been searching since the mid1800s for laws of ,Äúpsychophysics,Äů ,Äî laws relating the mental world to the physical (Chalmers said he too was searching for ,Äúpsychophysical laws,Äů in an article he published in 1995).

Cognicentrism is the most pernicious of the three errors. Some academics are so fascinated by their own internal movie ,Äî it is in full color, after all, with 3-D and surround sound ,Äî they think it must be real, never considering a much simpler and more sensible possibility.

As an exercise, please set aside for the moment the questionable assertion that consciousness is a thing or a place or a world or a movie; in other words, resist the temptation to reify. Also, please consider the possibility that the fact that you seem to have a strong sense of being you is not actually a big deal ,Äî not big enough to build a science around, anyway. Finally, even though you seem to have a movie playing in your head, please entertain the idea that the",Long 22182,524,193,3845
"### Self-supervised Learning

Techniques that leverage unlabeled data by generating supervision signals from the data itself, reducing dependence on human annotation.

Self-supervised learning represents a paradigm shift from the traditional supervised learning approach. Rather than requiring human-labeled examples, these methods create ""pseudo-labels"" from the data structure itself. In natural language processing, masked language modeling,Äîpredicting words that have been hidden in a sentence,Äîhas proven particularly effective. This approach, pioneered by models like BERT, enables systems to learn rich contextual representations from vast amounts of unlabeled text.

In computer vision, self-supervised techniques include predicting the relative position of image patches, colorizing grayscale images, or generating the missing portions of partially obscured images. Facebook's DINO (Self-Distillation with No Labels) system demonstrated that self-supervised learning can produce visual features that closely align with human perception, automatically identifying meaningful object boundaries without explicit training.

The success of self-supervised learning suggests that the structure of data itself contains rich information that can be leveraged for learning. This approach is particularly valuable for domains where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, such as medical imaging or industrial applications.

### Neuro-symbolic AI

Approaches that combine neural networks' pattern recognition capabilities with symbolic systems' logical reasoning, aiming to capture the best of both paradigms.

Neuro-symbolic AI represents an attempt to bridge the gap between connectionist approaches (neural networks) and symbolic AI (rule-based systems). This hybrid approach aims to combine the learning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of symbolic systems.

MIT's Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner demonstrates this approach by combining perception networks with symbolic reasoning for visual question answering. The system learns visual concepts, words, and semantic parsing of questions without explicit supervision, while maintaining interpretable representations that support reasoning.

IBM's Neuro-Symbolic AI integrates neural perception with symbolic knowledge and reasoning, enabling systems to learn from fewer examples and provide explanations for their conclusions. This approach shows promise for applications requiring both pattern recognition and logical reasoning, such as scientific discovery and medical diagnosis.

The neuro-symbolic approach addresses limitations of pure neural network approaches, including data inefficiency, lack of interpretability, and difficulty with systematic generalization. By incorporating symbolic knowledge and reasoning, these systems can potentially make better use of domain expertise and prior knowledge.

### Quantum Machine Learning

Exploring how quantum computing might accelerate certain AI algorithms or enable entirely new approaches.

Quantum machine learning investigates the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to perform certain computations exponentially faster than classical computers.

Quantum neural networks represent one promising direction, with architectures that exploit quantum effects for more efficient pattern recognition. These systems may offer advantages for high-dimensional data and complex optimization problems that challenge classical approaches.

Quantum support vector machines and quantum principal component analysis have demonstrated theoretical speedups over their classical counterparts. While practical implementations remain limited by current quantum hardware capabilities, companies including IBM, Google, and D-Wave are actively developing quantum machine learning algorithms and applications.

The potential impact of quantum computing on AI could be profound, particularly for problems involving complex simulations, optimization, or sampling. For instance, quantum approaches might accelerate the training of large neural networks or enable more efficient exploration of chemical and material properties for scientific discovery.

## Ethical Considerations and Societal Impact

The rapid advancement of AI raises profound ethical questions:

### Bias and Fairness

AI systems trained on historical data often perpetuate or amplify existing biases. Facial recognition systems have demonstrated lower accuracy for women and people with darker skin tones. Hiring algorithms have shown gender bias. Addressing these issues requires diverse training data, careful algorithm design, and ongoing monitoring.

A landmark study by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru found that commercial facial recognition systems had error rates up to 34.7% for darker-skinned women compared to just 0.8% for lighter-skinned men. These disparities arise when training data underrepresents certain demographic groups or reflects historical biases in society.

In hiring, Amazon abandoned an AI recruiting tool after discovering it penalized resumes containing the word ""women's"" (as in ""women's chess club"") because the historical hiring data it trained on reflected male dominance in the tech industry. Similarly, healthcare algorithms have shown racial bias, with one widely used system allocating less care to Black patients than equally sick white patients because it used past healthcare costs as a proxy for healthcare needs.

Addressing these issues requires technical approaches like balanced datasets, fairness constraints during training, and bias audits. Equally important are diverse development teams and inclusive design practices that consider potential impacts across different communities. The Algorithmic Justice League, founded by Buolamwini, advocates for more transparent and accountable AI through research, art, and policy advocacy.

### Privacy

Many AI applications rely on vast amounts of personal data. Techniques like federated learning and differential privacy aim to preserve privacy while enabling AI functionality, but tensions remain between data utility and privacy protection.

Traditional machine learning approaches require centralizing data for model training, creating privacy risks through data breaches or unauthorized access. Federated learning addresses this by keeping data on individual devices and only sharing model updates, not raw data. Google has implemented this approach in Android keyboards to improve next-word prediction without sending sensitive typing data to central servers.

Differential privacy provides mathematical guarantees about the maximum information that can be inferred about any individual from a dataset or model. Apple uses differential privacy for features like emoji suggestions and QuickType, adding carefully calibrated noise to user data before collection to protect individual privacy while still identifying useful patterns.

Despite these advances, privacy concerns persist. Voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa have faced criticism for recording private conversations, while facial recognition in public spaces enables mass surveillance. The increasing sophistication of re-identification attacks, which can deanonymize supposedly anonymous data, further complicates privacy protection efforts.

The tension between data utility and privacy protection remains a central challenge. More data typically improves AI performance, creating incentives for extensive data collection that may conflict with privacy values. Finding the right balance requires not just technical solutions but thoughtful governance frameworks and clear ethical guidelines.

### Autonomy and Accountability

As AI systems make more consequential decisions, questions arise about human oversight and responsibility. Who is accountable when an autonomous vehicle causes an accident or an AI medical system misdiagnoses a patient? Legal frameworks are still evolving to address these issues.

The concept of ""meaningful human control"" has emerged as a principle for high-stakes AI appli",Long 32759,,,
